NetHack Fourk Changelog Overview:
=================================

This document describes the changes that have been made in NetHack
Fourk specifically, which are different from the upstream NetHack 4
codebase.  For changes made in NetHack 4, see instead changelog.txt

Thematically, the major changes fall into the following overall
categories:

 * Balance adjustments.  Various formulae have been revised, to
   improve the overall balance and difficulty curve of the game.
   Things like engraving success rate, alignment record, to-hit
   calculations, etc. have had the shape of their curve adjusted, and
   some game features have been buffed or gently nerfed so that they
   fit better into the overall scheme of the game's balance.
   
 * Monster/class reorganization.  Some classes with very few monsters
   have been combined and thus freed up, so that in a subsequent
   version some heavily overloaded monster classes can be split,
   without running out of letters.  Some monsters have switched from
   one symbol/letter class to another one where they fit better.
   Additionally, some monsters that were formerly represented by
   punctuation marks are now represented by actual letters.  I have
   tried to be conservative about all of this, and for now I tried to
   avoid having any monster look exactly the same as another monster
   used to look, when it can be avoided.
   
 * Differentiation (aka improved variety).  Some monsters, items, or
   special levels that were practically identical have been tweaked
   slightly so that they are no longer quite so closely the same.
   Some special levels have entirely new versions, as well.

 * Consolidation.  Some meaningless things that didn't really add to
   the game have been removed or combined with others.  Monsters,
   objects, skills, etc.  You won't miss them.


Chronological Changelog (most recent at top):
=============================================
=============================================

Changes in 4.3.0.4:
-------------------

 * Pet hunger fixes have been cherry-picked from FIQHack, so
   pets will now only eat when hungry, but when they do eat, it
   takes time, like in 3.4.3.

 * Teleport control is disrupted by a mysterious force when you
   are carrying the Amulet of Yendor.

 * Added a new type of furniture terrain, benches.  Sitting or
   resting on a bench heals 1 hp per turn.

 * When sitting on a throne, the odds that it vanishes in a puff
   of logic have changed, as follows:
   + if you are playing in challenge mode, it always vanishes.
   + if you get a wish, it always vanishes.
   + if you get a positive result but not a wish (and are not
     in challenge mode), the odds are one in three, same as before.
   + if you get a negative result (and are not playing in challenge
     mode), there's a 10% chance that the throne vanishes
   + if you get the non-result (feel out of place), and are
     not in challenge mode, there's still a 5% chance it vanishes.

 * The game now tracks, as a conduct, whether you have ever had
   each of the following properties:  conflict, displacement,
   invisibility, and reflection.  To avoid leaking information
   about unidentified equipment, displacement is the only one
   of these that is reported in the conducts screen during the
   game; the others only show up in the dumplog.

 * Ghosts are invisible.  You can only see them if you can see
   invisible or have some other means of detecting them (such as
   warning, monster detection, etc.)

 * The sleep spell doesn't put things to sleep for as long.

 * The hints window ("extrawin") can now be turned off in the
   options.  Any space it would have taken up will be given to
   the message area instead.  If you do this from within a game,
   the display may not change until you leave ("save") the game
   and re-enter ("load") it again.

 * The target range for scrolls of stinking cloud has increased,
   and the beatitute of the scroll matters.  In the diagram below,
   standing on the location marked @, you can target any of the
   spaces marked with an X (assuming you can see there):
         blessed              uncursed             cursed 
   .XXXXXXXX@XXXXXXXX.  ..XXXXXXX@XXXXXXX..  ...XXXXXX@XXXXXX...
   .XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.  ..XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX..  ...XXXXXXXXXXXXX...
   .XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.  ...XXXXXXXXXXXXX...  ....XXXXXXXXXXX....
   ..XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX..  ...XXXXXXXXXXXXX...  ....XXXXXXXXXXX....
   ..XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX..  ....XXXXXXXXXXX....  .....XXXXXXXXX.....
   ...XXXXXXXXXXXXX...  .....XXXXXXXXX.....  ......XXXXXXX......
   ....XXXXXXXXXXX....  ......XXXXXXX......  ........XXX........
   .....XXXXXXXXX.....  ........XXX........  ...................
   .......XXXXX.......  ...................  ...................
   ...................  ...................  ...................

 * A number of race-specific and role-specific criteria have been
   added for altering your alignment record.
   + Barbarians get alignment points for killing monsters, in much
     the same way as all players in 3.4.3 (except you can only get
     at most one point per monster -- in practice this should still
     be plenty to make Barbarian the easiest role by a wide margin
     from an alignment record perspective).
   + Knights gain alignment by slaying hostile (adult) dragons.
   + Priests gain alignment by killing hostile undead monsters.
   + Tourists gain alignment when they are overcharged for a
     particular item in a shop.  (The "shirt bonus" doesn't count.)
   + Monks improve their alignment by fasting.
   + Dwarves gain (and Elves lose) alignment by chopping down trees.
   + Several races get a temporary alignment bonus for having racially
     aligned armor or weapons equipped; this goes away as soon as you
     unequip the item(s).  Similarly, gnomes get a bonus for carried
     gems, giants for carried gold, archeologists for carried
     artifacts and unique items, and Samurai for a wielded katana,
     yumi, or tsurugi.
   + Valkyries who throw Mjollnir (and catch it) will occasionally
     gain an alignment record point.

 * Stinking clouds now block light and vision (like boulders).

 * Introduced a new kind of monster, the jitterbug.  This critter
   is weak but fast, and it has the ability, after you hit it, to
   swap positions with you.

 * Yellow lights now emit light with a larger radius.  (Monsters
   emitting different ranges of light was going to be implemented
   in NetHack 3.2.0, but it was deferred for performance reasons.
   That was in roughly the 486 era, so I'm trying it again now.)

 * Lights are now on symbol e, eye or sphere or light.

 * Instead of the Castle, it is now possible to get the Palace, the
   Library, or the Laboratory.

 * Scrolls of consecration have been implemented.  Reading one of
   these will create an altar (or, if confused, a magic chest) at your
   feet (provided you are standing on untrapped floor of a room or
   corridor).  These are not randomly generated, but there's always
   one in the magic chest.  It is possible to write them, but they
   cost a lot of ink.  You can also wish for them.  The altar will be
   to Moloch if you are in Gehennom or the scroll is cursed, or
   otherwise will be of your starting alignment if the scroll is
   blessed or if you are in the quest.

 * The scroll of food detection has been removed from the game.
   The frequencies of some other scrolls have been increased to
   compensate.

 * Potions of gain energy are now significantly more useful for
   refilling your Pw when it is well below maximum (and slightly less
   effective at increasing your maximum Pw level).

 * The skill bonus for martial arts has changed; advancing the skill
   is now somewhat more worthwhile, in terms of damage you do.

 * Healers now start with a collection of healing herbs (eucalyptus,
   wolfsbane, garlic).

 * Individual pieces of armor now have minimum and maximum sizes for
   whether they will fit, depending on your body size.  Check the
   automatically-generated spoilers for the fit sizes of each piece of
   armor and the body size of each monster.  (Your racial monster is
   the one checked, e.g., Gnome if you are a Gnome, unless of course
   you are polymorphed, in which case it's your polymorph form.) See
   http://jonadab.jumpingcrab.com/nethack-stuff/spoilers-fourk/

 * More new Sokoban levels have been added.  Note, however, that
   solutions are now available for Fourk's sokoban levels in the
   NetHack Fourk spoilers:
   http://jonadab.jumpingcrab.com/nethack-stuff/spoilers-fourk/

 * Combining potions of healing and speed now results in potions of
   full healing.  (You can still get potions of extra healing by
   combining potions of healing with gain energy or gain level.)
   Combining potions of full healing and gain level results in
   potions of gain energy.  (You can still get potions of gain
   ability by combining full healing and gain energy.)

 * The extra healing that you get (above and beyond your maximum
   health, which increases your maximum) from potions of extra healing
   now diminishes asymptotically toward zero as your maximum health
   approaches 250.  Also, potions of extra healing are now the only
   potions that grant this extra healing (hence, in full retcon mode,
   their name).  Regular potions of healing cannot take you above your
   maximum health, and potions of full healing raise you to your max
   health or 250, whichever is less.  Monsters also no longer get the
   extra above-maximum healing from potions of healing and full
   healing, only from extra healing.

 * The use of fountains and sinks and the drinking of magical potions
   are now tracked as conducts.  To avert excessive spamminess, these
   conducts are only mentioned if you've kept them.

 * Some spell levels have changed, for balance reasons.  This is not
   as comprehensive as the full spell inventory review that I want to
   do, but it's a start.  Some spells are now easier to cast (e.g.,
   digging) and others are harder (e.g., charm monster).  See the
   spellbook section of the auto-generated spoiler for details.

 * In Sokoban, monsters that would ordinarly generate peaceful for
   your character because of alignment or race will instead generate
   hostile, unless they have the M2_NASTY flag (in which case they
   have their usual chance of being peaceful).  In practice, this
   means no more peaceful garter snakes, gnomes, orcs, etc. clogging
   up the boulder paths in Sokoban.

 * Kicking open secret doors and secret corridors is easier than
   before.

 * When you throw Mjollnir, if it fails to return to your hand, it now
   always lands safely at your feet, not dealing any damage to you.
   The 1% chance of harming yourself and more importantly your
   inventory may have been interesting flavor, but in practice it just
   meant Mjollnir was a worse choice for Valkyries than other artifact
   weapons, such as Excalibur or Frostbane or Grayswandir.  Mjollnir
   still has downsides (some monsters are shock-resistant, leaving you
   with the terrible base item damage; and the shock damage against
   your enemies can still destroy vulnerable items they may be holding
   in their inventories, such as rings); that's as may be, but you no
   longer risk hitting yourself with it.

 * If hand cramping, blindness, confusion, hallucination, or being
   stunned would have caused your hand to slip while writing,
   distorting the message, but your base constitution (without any
   bonus from rings, etc.) is more than 3, the engraving will be
   completed successfully, at the cost of one point of constitution.

 * Hand cramping (due to excessive engraving) has been made more
   consistent.  It no longer matters as much what you've written, but
   it matters much more how recently you've written it.  In addition
   to gradually healing naturally over time, cramps can also be
   reduced by drinking blessed potions of healing, extra healing, and
   full healing; and enlightenment can tell you how cramped your
   writing hand is.

 * When chargeable rings are generated, the game now tries even
   harder than before to avoid +0 ones.

 * The Priest quest artifact is now the Sceptre of Might.  Its #invoke
   power is an energy boost, similar to the one the Mitre (which is
   now removed from the game) had, but buffed somewhat:  it can boost
   your Pw by up to 240 now, and the limit on taking you to maximum
   has been bumped up as well.  Meanwhile, the Caveman quest artifact,
   Big Stick, was given the conflict #invoke effect.

 * Added giants as a playable race.  Giants can be barbarians,
   cavemen, or (for the time being at least) rangers.

 * The name of Elbereth only scares monsters if it is the only thing
   engraved there (although you can also use the more complete form
   of the name that Frodo used at Weathertop).

 * Levitation no longer places you at maximum carry capacity.

 * The odds of failure when wishing for an artifact are now higher
   if the artifact is cross-aligned than if it is co-aligned.

 * The xlog and livelog field separators now default to a horizontal
   tab character but can be customized at compile time by defining
   XLOGFILE_FIELD_SEPARATOR and LIVELOG_FIELD_SEPARATOR

 * Most creatures that are not afraid of Elbereth can still be
   frightened by a scroll of scare monster.  Exceptions are Rodney,
   lawful minions, Angels (specifically, not all A), and Riders.

 * The name Elbereth now works to frighten most humans (with notable
   exceptions being the shopkeepers, vault guards, the Minetown Watch,
   and of course the Wizard of Yendor).  Elves, of course, still don't
   fear the name of this Vala of light (because they revere her).

 * Your quest nemesis is not afraid of Elbereth.

 * Added a new random-appearance cloak, the cloak of endurance.  It
   does not provide MC but does grant half physical damage.

 * More special levels have been updated or changed, e.g., the Wizard
   quest locate level.

 * When skilled in wand use, the player may learn the number of
   remaining charges when zaping a wand.

 * Prayer is now shown in the history.

 * Wielding a quarterstaff now improves spell success rates.  This can
   help compensate (partially) both for armor penalties and also for
   the spell being too hard for your level or attributes.  When spell
   success rates are low (but not zero), enchanting the staff will
   generally improve them further.  However, quarterstaves now do less
   damage in melee than before.

 * Quest guardians may now be displaced.

 * Knights may now reach Expert in shield skill.  Barbarians may not.

 * Certain of the more pointless and/or redundant artifact weapons
   have been removed from the list.  Perhaps the most notable of these
   was Sunsword, which has been superceded by the improved Trollsbane.

 * Monsters now regenerate hitpoints somewhat faster than before.

 * Giant spiders now have a web-spinning attack, which causes
   temporary slowness (which times out), as well as causing you to be
   stuck in the web (same as stepping in one).  Spiders are immune.

 * Merged the DYWYPISI patch, by Jafet.  This causes end-of-game item
   identification to place information the player character did not
   know in brackets, so that you can tell (e.g. in the dumplog)
   whether an item was identified or not.  I expect players to find
   a few bugs in my adaptation of this patch; it's a bit complex,
   and I had to make some changes to the patch due to code divergence.

 * Dwarves in the Gnomish Mines now sometimes carry candles
   (monster starting inventory).  Gnomes do not.

 * Quantum mechanics are now considered humanoid (h).

 * Gnomes, due to their small size, cannot wear body armor.
   (Neither can scurriers.)  However, Gnomes can now see in the dark.

 * Added a new playable race, scurriers.  Scurriers are bipedal
   humanoid rodents -- something like a cross between a rabbit, a
   squirrel, and a human.  They are small, fast, and stealthy and have
   a natural digging ability, all of which makes them very well suited
   to avoiding combat rather than engaging in it.  They can be
   archeologists, rangers, or tourists.

 * The formula for how many moves you get per turn has changed.  Five
   factors contribute more or less independently:  your "base speed",
   which is based on your race; whether you are intrinsically "fast"
   or not; whether you have extrinsic speed (e.g., from speed boots);
   whether you are temporarily hasted (as from a spell of haste self
   or a potion of speed); and whether you are temporarily slowed
   (e.g., by a spider's web attack).  These all stack; but
   individually some of them don't do as much as before.

 * Wielding Stormbringer now causes peaceful and tame monsters to
   attack you.  It also stops conflict from working in your favor.
   However, the interface problems it creates in 3.4.3 (wherein you
   attack things you don't intend to attack) are not present:  you
   have the normal amount of control over your actions, can displace
   your pets as usual, chat with shopkeepers, etc.  (If you actually
   want to attack peaceful and tame monsters, you can of course do so
   using the Fight command as usual, with the usual caveats.)

 * The life cycle for D has been extended.  They now start life as
   a [color] dragon egg, hatch into a baby [color] dragon, then grow
   progressively into a young [color] dragon, a [color] dragon, an
   elder [color] dragon, and finally into an ancient [color] dragon.
   The more they advance, the more dangerous they become.  The
   top two levels, elder and ancient, are not generated randomly.
   Any age of dragon that lays eggs lays the same type of dragon
   egg, in its respective color, which will hatch into a baby.

 * Support has been added for receiving dgamelaunch SimpleMail
   messages, when playing on a dgamelaunch-based public server,
   provided the server admin has set an environment variable to
   tell the game where to find the player's inbox.

 * The shallow water portion of the L terrain patch has been merged.
   This changes a number of existing special levels and also adds
   a new version of Minetown.

 * Stealth is no longer binary (all or nothing); there are degrees
   now:  you can be more or less stealthy.  Examples of things that
   are good for your stealth include:  being a elf (this is especially
   good), a sylph, or a gnome; wearing an elven cloak; wearing elven
   boots; wearing a +1 or better ring of steath; having basic or
   better skill in stealth; using sufficiently light equipment that
   you would still be unburdened even if its weight were doubled.
   Going the other way, being burdened or worse hurts your stealth.
   Being more stealthy decreases the odds that sleaping monsters will
   wake up when you are around (via normal actions, such as walking;
   things like exploding a gas spore still wake stuff up anyway).

 * Monsters are now generated asleep in a wider variety of situations,
   especially at level generation time.

 * Protection from rings of protection, the spell of protection, and
   cloak of protection now add into your magic cancellation level, in
   addition to the base MC from your worn armor.  From armor alone you
   can reach MC3 and with protection up to MC5.  The odds of magic
   cancellation completely canceling an attack (of a type that MC can
   cancel) are now 22%, 44%, 65%, 87%, or 98% for levels 1-5.  Even if
   the attack is not completely canceled, the "worst effects" may
   still be blocked.  For example, in the case of a fire, cold, or
   lightning attack, the odds of your inventory being protected from
   destruction are 61% at MC1, 86% at MC2, 94% at MC3, 98% at MC4,
   100% at MC5.  A sleep or paralysis attack that isn't blocked
   completely does have its duration shortened -- higher MC shortens
   it more.  Brain eating attacks, which could not be blocked by MC at
   all in vanilla, can now have their worst effects nerfed, though
   this is not totally guaranteed even at MC5.  At MC4 or better,
   drain attacks cannot take your last three experience levels and
   xans cannot wound your legs.  Higher MC may give you extra turns
   when subject to delayed instadeath (illness, some sources of
   stoning) or protect you from attribute loss or deadly poison
   (sometimes) or your armor from rusting or corrosion.  MC3 or higher
   may delay drowning attacks (no guarantees) and protect you from
   attribute loss due to seduction.  This list is not exhaustive.

 * Cornuthaums now improve your wisdom and intelligence by their
   enchantment, as a helm of brilliance does.  Their other effects
   are unchanged.

 * For public-server installations, dgamelaunch simple mail is
   now supported.

 * Some object weights have been adjusted to match the 3.6.0 values.

 * Monster starting inventory has been further adjusted, for
   flavor and balance.

 * Lances now get the same "kebab" bonus as spears.

 * Dragonbane is now a lance.  Knights can get it by crowning.

 * Gryphons have been added to the game; they may be useful as
   steeds in the midgame, since they can fly but are rather
   faster than dragons, easier to get than jabberwocks.

Changes in 4.3.0.3:
-------------------

 * Quasits are sometimes generated invisible.  Also, they can always
   see invisible.

 * Magic mapping no longer makes explored and unexplored territory
   indistinguishable (in lit areas).  Thus players who care about
   keeping track of such things (e.g. so as not to miss any floor
   items) can freely use magic mapping.

 * Merged several patches from L, http://l.j-factor.com/nethack/
   The "whack" patch causes more differentiated weapon hit messages.
   The "wounds" patch gives Healers information about how wounded
   monsters are, as a role special ability.

 * Patric Mueller's Advent Calendar patch has been merged.

 * Several bug fixes have been cherry-picked or merged from FIQ,
   for Fourk bugs, NH4 bugs, and even a couple of vanilla bugs.

 * Cherry-picked FIQ's rework of the Summon Nasties code.  The
   number of monsters summoned should be more consistent now,
   although it's still random.

 * Couatls have more resistances than before.

 * The following monsters have gained sleep resistance that did
   not have it previously:  werewolves, all mindless monsters,
   most major demons (notably excepting foocubi), and the fabled
   Wizard of Yendor.

 * Monsters under the influence of conflict will attack in melee,
   despite scary things written on the ground beneath your feet.

 * Stinking clouds now display differently than before, in the
   text-based tilesets.  They now use the same cyan background color
   as traps (on the theory that both traps and stinking clouds are
   typically places you don't want to step into) and do not change the
   foreground color.

 * Weaponless characters can get items other than weapons as
   sacrifice gifts.  Notably, weaponless spellcasters can get
   spellbooks.  Armor and rings are also possible.

 * Some special levels have been changed, or new versions have
   been introduced.  Notable examples include Mine's End, the
   Monk and Rogue quest locate levels, and the last maze level
   before the Castle.

 * Documentation is now available on the differences between normal
   mode and challenge mode.  See doc/challengemode.txt

 * Eating too much no longer runs a risk of choking to death.
   However, it can make you bloated, which slows you down.  (This is
   temporary.  As you digest the food and return to a normal hunger
   status, you return to normal speed as well.)  There's no hard
   maximum on how satiated you can become, but in practice getting
   close to 4000 nutrition will slow you down so much you won't
   be able to eat fast enough to become more satiated.   

 * Price-checking has been made less tedious:  you can no longer
   get a different price by repeatedly dropping the same item,
   or by trying to sell different items of the same type.  For
   any given type of item, either the shopkeeper will always
   offer you 25% less than expected, or he never will.

 * The inventory sidebar now shows total item count and weight.

 * Players who can reach the Quest Leader without gaining any
   experience levels (and, in challenge mode, without breaking
   pacifist conduct either) can be admitted to the quest at
   experience level 1, on the strength of their undeniable 
   audacity.  (The other requirements still apply, e.g., you
   still have to be pious.)

 * Restoring lost levels now only reduces your max level (so that you
   can only regain half of your lost levels) if you are playing in
   challenge mode.  In normal mode, you can regain them all.

 * Levels containing a cockatrice may also have statues.

 * Wizard starting inventory has been rebalanced, since they
   can now cast spells effectively in the early game.

 * Added Valerian, an artifact dagger with a special sort of poison
   that puts things to sleep -- if they do not resist.  This dagger
   is the first sacrifice gifts for Rogues.  It is chaotic and is
   intelligent and will blast all non-Rogues.

 * Added Quickpick, an artifact pick-axe that is mainly useful for
   improved digging speed; it also gets a bonus against all deep
   rock dwellers (X).

 * Added a new special room type, dragon halls.

 * Mass key rebindings have been added for Dvorak Simplified Keyboard
   layout (uyxd/pfkb movement) and also for axwd/qezc movement (mainly
   intended for players who are new to roguelikes but don't want to
   use the numpad for whatever reason).  As before, individual keys
   can still be rebound on a key-by-key basis; the mass rebindings are
   just a convenient way to do a whole set at once.  An SVG file is
   provided showing the three major layouts (traditional hjkl/yubn,
   axwd/qezc, and Dvorak), see doc/keyboard-layouts-nethack.svg

 * Several new Sokoban levels have been added, based on some of the
   Slash'em Sokoban puzzles (modified to be less dangerous).  One of
   these replaces both of the ring-prize levels.  If you draw this
   level, your sokoban prize is a sack containing a ring of polymorph
   control, a ring of teleport control, and an extra random ring.

 * Wresting the last charge out of a wand is somewhat less
   tedious now than before.  It can still take several tries,
   but it's now ridiculously unlikely to take dozens of tries.

 * Trollsbane now lights up and instantly petrifies trolls.

 * Flint generates in larger stacks than previously.

 * Added historic events, xlogfile event bits, and livelog lines for
   entering the Minetown temple (the first time) and for reaching the
   bottom of the Mines.  Also added historic events and xlogfile event
   bits for opening a magic chest and entering the Sokoban zoo and
   an xlogfile event for entering the Astral Plane.

 * In the early game when you really need it, eating a newt corpse
   is now significantly likely to boost your max Pw.

 * The following behaviors (or lack thereof) are now tracked as
   conducts:  putting on clothing or armor (starting gear counts;
   there is a birth option to control whether it gets autoequipped);
   putting on jewelry or eyewear; using unicorn horns; using
   containers; and applying tools (other than for the invocation).
   To avoid making the end-game messages any spammier than they
   already are, these conducts are only announced if you kept them.

 * Role starting attribute numbers have been adjusted, as follows:
   priests now usually start with more Int than Wis, the opposite to
   their vanilla situation, so they can read and cast a wider variety
   of spells as early as possible -- at the expense of being able to
   cast them frequently; and Wizards have had their starting Wis
   buffed at the expense of several other attributes, so they can get
   decent Pw regen early and cast often.

 * Higher wisdom now improves your Pw regeneration rate, for everyone
   except Sylphs (who have their own formula).  Players who have been
   playing Wizards as non-casting fighters for the first half of the
   game may wish to revisit their approach.

 * Wisdom is much more difficult to exercise than before.
   To keep things balanced, it's also harder to abuse.

 * All roles now use Int as their "casting" stat to determine
   spell failure rates.

 * The damage bonus for martial arts now depends on skill.

 * Puddings now split slightly unevenly:  one of the two puddings will
   be a little weaker than the original, and the other will be a
   little stronger (in terms of max hitpoints).

 * Thrown weapons now receive their inherent to-hit bonus, if
   applicable.  (Previously they got a to-hit bonus based on
   enchantment but missed out on their base to-hit bonus for being the
   kind of weapon that they are.  This is relevant for daggers,
   although it was implemented mostly for Vlad's blood spitting,
   which needed the bonus to be able to hit late-game players.)

 * In addition to your defense score, damage reduction also depends
   on the attacking monster's chance to hit you.  If the monster
   had a higher chance to hit you, the amount of defense you need
   in order to get damage reduction is higher.

 * Imported magic chests from DynaHack.  Any item put into a magic
   chest can be looted out of any other magic chest in the dungeon,
   placed at set locations.  This greatly reduces tedious stash
   consolidation and transporting of items to and from stashes and
   fixed dungeon resources like altars, shops and water.

 * Completing Sokoban according to the rules now gets you experience.
   This may be of interest to pacifists.

 * Merged FIQ's wand balance implementation: so now the effectiveness
   of wands depends on the skill level of the player or monster
   that is zapping the wand.  Players can exercise and enhance wand
   skill as with other skills.  Monsters just have whatever skill
   level they have, depending on what kind of monster it is.  If
   the wand is blessed or cursed, the effectiveness is adjusted by
   one level, and if an unskilled user zaps a cursed one, it explodes.
   I also introduced wands in starting inventory for more roles.
   NOTE: the wand balance patch contains several "gotcha" changes,
   things that can catch you off guard if you expect wands to be
   like vanilla.  For example, at low skill levels, zapping a wand
   of teleportation at a monster to teleport it away will not work
   on a non-teleport level.  Players are advised to read the wiki
   article, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Wands_Balance_Patch

 * Added a "new" type of amulet, the amulet of flying.  (Slash'em
   has had this for a long time, of course.)

 * Corpse and death drop rates are restored to their vanilla levels
   (with a bug fix from the 2014 leak via 4.3-maint).  My changes to
   this were not accomplishing what they intended to accomplish and,
   as near as I can tell, did not significantly improve game balance.
   So they are reverted.

 * Upstream (NH4) changes merged during the 4.3.0.3 cycle include the
   user interaction mode rewrite (including the attackhostile setting
   for the movecommand option, which stops the game from asking if you
   want to attack peaceful monsters, assuming that if you wanted to do
   that you would have used the Fight prefix) and the M3_SCENT monster
   flag (which allows certain monsters, e.g., canines, to pinpoint
   your location by scent when they are close to you, even if they
   can't see you).  There were also code quality improvements for
   maintainability, notably, more globals purge.

 * The degree to which a worn shield adds to your AC to prevent you
   from being hit is now a function of your skill with the shield,
   which is exercised as you use the shield in combat.

 * Large deep-rock dwellers (X) now include xorns, umber hulks,
   ettins, and deep ettins.

 * Gelatinous cubes, acid blobs, and quivering blobs now appear
   as lowercase j, along with jellies.

 * Lizards (everything that formerly looked like a colon, :) are
   now represented by a lowercase l, which stands for lizard.

 * Piercers are now in mlet t, things that pretend to be part of
   the ceiling/wall/floor until you wander into them, then attack.

 * Vlad has been buffed.  His level and AC have been improved, and he
   has received cold resistance, shock resistance, infravision, see
   invisible, and a vampire-blood spitting attack that drains levels.

 * There is now unholy water on the top level of Vlad's Tower.

Changes in 4.3.0.2:
-------------------

 * It is possible to specify COLNO and ROWNO at compile time (put
   something like -DROWNO=30 in the CFLAGS environment variable
   when running aimake).  Note that changing these values breaks
   save compatibility and is known to be buggy at this time.

 * Added the Geoduck tileset, by Robert M. Cook.  This tileset is
   based on the idea of prominently incorporating the traditional
   ASCII symbols for each monster (and in many cases item) into
   the graphical tile, but with enough added detail that you can
   more easily see and remember what it is.  It may be of interest
   to beginners who wish to eventually play in ASCII or Unicode
   mode but are intimidated by it at first.

 * Excalibur is now easier to get for Knights, harder for others.

 * Gehennom is now mostly composed of a new type of cavern level,
   generated by the ais cavern algorithm.  Mazes can still be found
   in Gehennom on special levels, for now.

 * The number of maze levels between Medusa's Island and the Castle
   has been increased slightly.

 * The #enhance screen how shows you both your current skill level
   and your skill cap (maximum level your character can achieve).

 * Sylphs can no longer be Valkyries; but they can be Rangers and,
   for the time being, Wizards.  (Sylph Wizard is highly tentative
   and may get removed if it proves too unbalanced.)

 * Wands of digging now dig multiple tiles in Gehennom (and other
   maze levels), the same as everywhere else.

 * Any weapon you get in starting inventory will have a skill cap
   no less than basic.  (Your starting skill was already being
   raised to basic.  This prevents you from being above your max.)

 * Dwarves can now always get to at least skilled in pick-axe,
   and can get to expert if a human of the same role would be
   able to get to skilled.

 * Gnomes can always get to skilled in crossbow and aklys and can
   go two skill ranks higher than a human of the same role, up to
   a maximum of expert (crossbow) or master (club).

 * Orcs can get at least skilled in scimitar and two ranks higher
   than a human of the same role up to a maximum of master.

 * Sylphs can always get at least basic skill in healing spells,
   regardless of their role, and can get to skilled if a human of
   the same role could get to basic.

 * The scroll of amnesia has been removed from the game.  It is
   replaced with the scroll of water, which generally creates pools
   around the player.  (Some dungeon features can be destroyed by
   this, replaced with a pool; others, such as stairs, cannot.)  If
   cursed, one of the pools will be placed at the player's location.
   If blessed, there is a small chance to get a fountain instead.
   Although the scroll of amnesia was one of the most useless items
   and thus was never given as starting inventory, I consider the
   scroll of water to be potentially more useful than the scroll of
   punishment, which previously could be; so scroll of water can be
   given as starting inventory, and scroll of punishment now cannot.
   Note that the scroll of water will not work on the Planes.

 * Intelligence-draining attacks no longer also cause amnesia.

 * Multi-firing is more difficult when using silver projectiles.
   (They're still advantageous against silver-fearing targets, of
   course, because the increased silver damage is worth more than
   a higher multi-fire rate.)

 * Added a new type of stone, silver nuggets.  These count as sling
   ammo and do silver damage.  The best place to find silver nuggets
   is on the caveman quest, but they can also be generated randomly.

 * The Rogue quest now contains a guaranteed spellbook of sleep.

 * Further alignment record adjustments have been made.  The penalties
   for attacking peacefuls and for killing generated-peaceful and
   always-peaceful monsters have been adjusted again.  Non-lawfuls now
   get no penalty for killing mundane peaceful monsters; killing
   always-peaceful ones still has a penalty for all alignments, but it
   is smaller than before.  Lawful characters can regain alignment
   points by killing hostile chaotic demons.  The alignment benefits
   of sacrifice have been restored to their vanilla level of
   effectiveness.  Using a poisoned weapon while lawful will no longer
   take your record below 0.

 * Valkyrie starting inventory has been rebalanced again.  They
   always get the wand of cold now, and their starting enchants
   have been rebalanced again.

 * Sokoban tries to give you a prize you don't already have.  For
   example, if the level you get would normally have a bag of holding
   but you already have one and don't yet have reflection, an amulet
   of reflection may be substituted in place of the bag.  There are
   limits to how creative the game gets, however; you can still end up
   with something redundant if you already have more than one of the
   possible prizes.  Note that unidentified rings you are carrying
   can have an impact on which ring you get as your prize, even if
   they are not equipped.  Also, the prize is determined at the moment
   the prize level is generated, so if you enter the level but don't
   finish it and come back later, the prize is not changed again.

 * Rogues now get the "backstab" bonus if the target monster is
   fleeing (strike from behind); frozen, trapped, or unable to move
   (catch at a disadvantage); or sleeping, blind, confused, or stunned
   (strike unaware).

 * Grimtooth is permanently poisoned and also grants poison resistance;
   additionally it warns of elves and does extra damage to them, even
   if they are poison resistant.

 * The call/name menu implicitly allows alternate menu accelerators:
   a for C, b for y, c for n.  (This is to accommodate players whose
   muscle-memory was trained on NAO.)

 * Barbarians attacking with an axe or battle-axe at Skilled or better
   get free bonus attacks against adjacent enemies.  In each of the
   diagrams below, you (@) attack a monster at target position (T),
   and any monsters at the free-attack positions (F) will be attacked
   as well.  Also, Barbarians can now get Master skill in axe.

   Skilled ("wide arc"):
   .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....
   ...F.  .F...  .FTF.  .....  .TF..  ..FT.  .....  .....
   ..@T.  .T@..  ..@..  ..@..  .F@..  ..@F.  ..@F.  .F@..
   ...F.  .F...  .....  .FTF.  .....  .....  ..FT.  .TF..
   .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....

   Master ("tremendous arc"):
   .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....
   ..FF.  .FF..  .FTF.  .....  .TFF.  .FFT.  ...F.  .F...
   ..@T.  .T@..  .F@F.  .F@F.  .F@..  ..@F.  ..@F.  .F@..
   ..FF.  .FF..  .....  .FTF.  .F...  ...F.  .FFT.  .TFF.
   .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....

 * Lower-level nymphs now blink away when they steal something.
   Blinking normally works on a straight-line clear-path basis (sort
   of like line of sight, but they can blink into the dark or when
   blind) with a distance based on the nymph's level.  (However, if
   there are no available spaces to blink to, the nymph may be placed
   farther away.)  For wood and water nymphs, this replaces their
   ability to teleport at random times or warp to an entirely random
   location when stealing.  One side-effect of this change is that you
   can no longer get intrinsic teleportitis by eating them, which
   seems fair.  Mountain nymphs, which are higher level, blink when
   they steal but can also teleport at other times; and you CAN get
   teleportitis by eating them.  I reduced the mountain nymphs'
   frequency number (from 2 to 1), but they can now generate in small
   groups (the only n to do so).  Also, a fourth, even higher level
   type of nymph has been added, the island nymph.  These warp away
   just like vanilla nymphs; of course you can get teleportitis by
   eating them.  They normally generate infrequently but can be
   summoned by the Summon Nasties monster spell.

 * A new playable race has been added, Sylph.  Sylphs are a type of
   elemental fairy creature.  As such, they have fairy senses and so
   tend to see monsters as they are, rather than as they appear --
   they see invisible and are not fooled by shape changers, and they
   get infravision at level 5 and intrinsic detect monsters at level
   16.  They also get stealth at level 5 and displacement at 7.
   Perhaps most interestingly, Sylphs regenerate health and power by
   drawing from their environment (which can heal status effects as
   well as restore HP and Pw), but in order to do so they must be able
   to feel the natural world around them -- the air on their skin, the
   ground under their toes, etc.  Thus, they cannot draw power and
   health if wearing armor made of anything but cloth or wood (except
   for their own quest artifact), or if they are levitating, or while
   polymorphed.  (Also, there is very little healing to be drawn from
   the environment in Gehennom.)  Sylphs are always female.  They can
   be neutral or chaotic and can currently be Priests, Rogues,
   Healers, Rangers, or Wizards.

 * Attribute maxima now depend on role as well as race.
   The role contributions are as follows (where 1 places
   the character's overall maximum where it was in vanilla):
   Rol | Str Int Wis Dex Con Cha
   ----+-------------------------
   Arc |  1   1   1   1   1   1
   Bar |  2   0   0   2   2   0
   Cav |  3   0   0   1   1   1
   Hea |  0   1   2   1   1   1
   Kni |  2   2   0   0   0   2
   Mon |  2   1   2   1   0   0
   Pri |  1   2   0   1   2   0
   Rog |  1   1   0   2   1   1
   Ran |  1   1   1   2   0   1
   Sam |  2   0   1   2   1   0
   Tou |  0   1   2   1   0   2
   Val |  1   1   1   2   1   0
   Wiz |  0   2   2   1   0   1
   These values are experimental; some of them will probably
   need to be adjusted, but this is a starting point.

 * Ice devils now have an attack that immobilizes the target
   in ice.  (Fiery monsters, such as fire elementals, are not
   immobilized but sustain damage.)

 * Piranha generate in larger groups and have more attacks.

 * Mazes in Gehennom can now have wall and/or corridor widths
   other than 1 tile.  Occasionally, they can have "walls" that
   are not made of wall or rock.

 * Hezrou now have a passive attack that gives off a foul stench
   (implemented as stinking cloud).

 * "melon" is now the default name for custom fruit.

 * The number of different kinds of polearms has been reduced.
   Also, stiletto is no longer a distinct object from knife.

 * The "stone giant" has been renamed to just "giant", meaning
   its corpse can now be used for things like giant mummies,
   eliminating the need for the otherwise-unused generic "giant"
   monster.  This reduces the number of monsters in monst.c by
   one, with probably no gameplay effect at all.

 * Cavemen have had their race and alignment options adjusted.

 * The Caveman quest artifact is now Big Stick, an artifact club.
   Big Stick good.  Hit things with it.  Bam.  Bam bam.  If I did
   the coding correctly, it grants stealth when carried and magic
   resistance when wielded.  The bonus is +5 to-hit, +1d12 damage.

 * Mastodons have been replaced with mammoths.


Changes in 4.3.0.1:
-------------------

 * The game calls unseen monsters "something" rather than "it",
   since in many cases there is no (or a misleading) antecedent.

 * Sinks are usually placed next to walls.

 * Throwing gauntlets at a peaceful monster makes it hostile,
   allowing you to kill it without incurring the usual alignment
   penalty for angering or killing a generated-peaceful monster.

 * There are now four versions of Orcus Town.

 * There are now two versions of Asmodeus' Lair and two versions
   of Baalzebub's, but in any given game you only get one of them
   (i.e., you either get Asmo or Baal, not both).  However, you also
   get either Yeenoghu's Plaza or Dispater's Gauntlet, so the total
   number of demon lairs per game is the same as vanilla.

 * Random rooms, if large enough, can sometimes be non-rectangular.

 * The alignment record penalties for killing peaceful monsters have
   been rebalanced, and your maximum and minimum alignment record
   are always 100 and -100, respectively.

 * Changed the Caveman/Cavewoman rank titles.

 * Chaotics get alignment points for killing (hostile members of)
   their own race.

 * Neutrals can get alignment points for successful prayer (when not
   in trouble) even if their alignment record is already positive.

 * Lawfuls now reliably get an alignment point each time they help
   someone out of a trap (previously, you had a random chance of
   getting the point, depending on luck).

 * Slings have been buffed.  They now get a damage bonus (albeit, a
   reduced one compared to melee).  Cavemen get a multishot bonus for
   using a sling.  Flint and hard gems are less likely to break.
   Dual-wielding two slings lets you fire (on average) twice as many
   projectiles, provided your stack of projectiles is large enough;
   this uses your sling skill, not two-weapon skill (although you do
   still have to be capable of two-weapon combat to do it).

 * The range for projectiles fired from a launcher has been increased,
   especially for crossbow bolts.

 * Shamelessly copied the multiple-bones-pools implementation from
   NAO, then enhanced it to keep separate pools for each game mode
   (normal, explore, wizmode, setseed, polyinit).  I'd like to see
   this eventually go in upstream (but not until the next save break,
   because bones files from before the change won't load after).

 * Some monsters have been given more interesting attacks.  Notably,
   pit fiends now have an attack that creates pits.

 * Fixing status ailments with a unicorn horn is now mostly free; the
   only penalty is that a blessed horn can become uncursed.  Blessed
   horns are now guaranteed to fix at least one trouble (assuming you
   have any they can fix).  However, restoring lost attributes with a
   unicorn horn now always degrades its enchantment.

 * When you lose alignment points, you now get warning messages
   about it.  You also get messages when you regain alignment.

 * Engraving Elbereth no longer exercises wisdom.

 * Engravings are no longer degraded by walking, and the probability
   that random actions or inactions (including resting, searching)
   will erode an engraving is greatly reduced.  However, engraving
   additional text degrades what is already there.

 * Lizards (specifically), acid blobs, F, P, and T are guaranteed to
   drop corpses for the first hundred kills per monster type.

 * The effect of weapon skill on chance to hit has been magnified,
   and being restricted is now worse than being unskilled.

 * Bugfix: the monstr value for floating eyes was being calculated
   incorrectly, due to the way they are implemented.  This was
   causing them to generate too often too early.

 * Added a digit to the version number, so I can do more than one
   release based on a given version of upstream, without getting my
   version numbers horribly out of sync.

 * The chance for thrown projectiles to break now depends primarily on
   your skill.  Enchanted objects get an extra chance to survive (and
   negatively enchanted ones get an extra chance to break).

 * You can now #untrap falling rock traps, obtaining rocks.
   Also, disarming a projectile trap (rocks, arrows, or darts)
   now produces a few more projectiles than previously.

 * Players who wish to use spears should be able to find more
   of them now, introduced via the monster inventory mechanism.

 * Quasits have been buffed slightly, because they're boring, but
   I don't want to just remove them if they can be made interesting.

 * Manes are now in the W mlet, with wraiths and ghosts and other
   spirits of the dead.  This fits their flavour much better than
   their previous mlet assignment and also reduces color conflicts.

 * Rings that are dropped down a sink end up buried in the ground
   under the sink.  They can be reclaimed by destroying the sink,
   drying up the resulting fountain, and digging up the rings,
   which will now be identified.

 * The backstab bonus now scales with your skill in whatever weapon
   you are using.  Currently, the bonus potentially goes as high as 28
   per hit if you are expert but falls off significantly at lower
   skill levels.  This change probably gives rogues a very powerful
   mid-game, without making them overpowered in the late game; but
   it will need play testing for balance.

 * Added single-use wish sources at the top of Vlad's tower
   and in Orcus Town.  (Update: and one in the Wizard's Tower.)

 * The Wizard of Yendor gets more starting inventory now.  Some
   of it might actually be useful at that stage of the game.

 * Cherry-picked the "monsters get better equipment in Gehennom"
   feature from the Gehennom Fun Patch.  Also, arrow traps in
   Gehennom may yield silver arrows.

 * Now that Sokoban is somewhat easier for the haters to bypass or
   deal with in some other way without properly solving it, we're
   free to add a few new Sokoban levels:
   + Add four new versions of Soko-1: "Boomerang Boulders", "Through
     the Cracks", "Easy Peasey", and "First Things First".  The two
     existing vanilla versions are retained also, for a total of six.
   + Add three new versions of Soko-2, for a total of four.
     The added versions are "Fly on the Wall", "Boulder Halls
     of Zim", and "Two-Phase".  One of the existing vanilla
     versions is also retained.  The infamous "Sokoban 2 B"
     (steelypips) aka "soko2a" (nethackwiki) is excluded.
   + Add two new versions of Soko-3, for a total of four.
     The new ones are "Bring 'em on Down" and "Slot Machine".
   + Add one new version of Soko-4, "'Ring 'em Around", with
     the prize being a ring of polymorph control.
   I have some reservations about a couple of these, but it's hard
   for me to be objective about them, since I created them.  I've
   included them for now, pending user feedback.

 * The Oracle can now sell you enlightenment, in addition to the
   other services.  Also, the prices are calculated differently,
   in a way that should make them lower in the early game.

 * Monkeys are better at stealing things and getting away.

 * Additional rocks are sometimes generated on the floor of rooms.
   This is mainly a balance change, to prevent sling users from
   trivially running out of ammo -- sling has to have _some_ kind
   of advantage, as it's worse than other ranged weapons in most
   ways.  However, it also makes flavor sense, IMO, to have a lot
   of rocks laying around.

 * Wands of wishing are no longer rechargeable.

 * Role rebalance, round one.
   + Starting inventory has been adjusted for some roles: a bit more
     ammo or an additional spell book; low-percentage-chance items are
     either guranteed or removed, or you get a consolation prize if
     you don't get them; healers get eucalyptus; some roles get small
     enchantment adjustments on starting equipment.
   + Several role/race and role/alignment combinations are permitted
     that previously were not, and in one case vice versa.
   + The Barbarian role has had its melee skill options and quest
     artifact buffed.  (The Heart can now be invoked for a
     remove-curse effect; Barbarians get the blessed remove curse
     effect; other roles get the uncursed effect.)
   + Valkyries, Knights, and Samurai have had their melee prowess
     reduced a bit (so that their melee options are worse than
     Barbarians) but are compensated in other ways.
     - Valkyries now start with different inventory and can find a
       spellbook of cone of cold on quest home.  Their casting
       abilities still need to be balanced so they can use attack
       spells without becomming general-purpose casters.  I may need
       to give them starting skill in attack, we'll see.  Also,
       Valkyries fly now.
     - Knights can now get expert in crossbow, can find spare lances
       and a spare saddle on quest home, will not fall off and die
       when mounting their pony on turn 1, and will not break their
       lance while jousting if at least devoutly aligned.  Figuring
       out how to get to devout as early as possible under the Fourk
       alignment record formula is left as an exercise.
     - Samurai are guaranteed a longsword and some replacement ya and
       a saddle on the quest, and the Tsurugi now provides extrinsic
       speed when wielded.

 * Pulled in about fifty fixes for various vanilla bugs from an
   upstream "4.3 maintenance" branch.  The upstream master branch
   hasn't merged these changes yet for reasons involving release
   timing, but Fourk is at a different place in its dev cycle that
   makes them appropriate now.

 * The luck penalty in Sokoban can now be avoided by carrying a
   non-cursed luckstone or by hallucinating.  Also, the Sokoban luck
   penalty will never take your luck below -3.

 * The Statue of Perseus is now guaranteed to contain the shield of
   reflection and the sack (and the scimitar, just because).  This is
   mainly intended as a sop for players who insist on skipping
   Sokoban.  At least you don't have to do the Castle with no
   reflection and no container.

 * The differences between the different versions of Minetown have
   been enhanced.  Previously, several of them felt almost the same
   as one another.  Hopefully that is not the case now.

 * Barring bones, the only variant of Minetown that might not have a
   general store now is College Town, which has a guaranteed book
   shop, so you can at least easily price check scrolls (and books).

 * The Mimic of the Mines level has been made more interesting,
   bringing it somewhat closer to the other Mine's End levels in terms
   of both difficulty and loot.

 * Certain normally rare items are supplied in small numbers early in
   the game as floor items.  Specifically, filler levels at depth 2-6
   in the main dungeon each have an 80% chance to get one of these
   items, which is most often a scroll of scare monster but can also
   be wolfsbane, eucalytus, or a wand of enlightenment.

 * The ever controversial and rather boring Acehack/NetHack4 floating
   eye behavior (wherein you can't melee them at all) has been
   replaced with a new behavior that will probably be equally
   controversial but hopefully more interesting:  whatever hp damage
   you do to the floating eye you also sustain yourself, amplified
   proprortionally to your own experience level.  The exact formula
   may need to be tweaked, pending play testing.  The formula for
   monster-vs-monster is different from the formula for
   player-vs-monster, not because I think it should be, but because
   rebalancing player hitpoints vs monster hitpoints is a larger
   change that I didn't want to rush into yet.

 * Insteadeath by poison when you could have survived the damage
   will now only drain a level rather than killing you outright,
   if you are at least XL3.  Furthermore, starting characters have
   a 500-turn grace period to reach XL3 to protect against this.
   (You can still die by falling onto poisoned spikes or being hit by
   a poisoned weapon or whatever, if you do not have enough current HP
   to survive the damage that it does, or if you are running around
   at XL1 or XL2 past turn 500.)

 * The supply of rocks (embedded within the rock) has been increased,
   because slings are bad enough, compared to other launchers, without
   having to constantly worry about running out of rocks (which aren't
   even supposed to be the primary ammo; they're what you use when
   you're trying to conserve or have run out of flint and glass).

 * The Wizard of Yendor now has an attack that can change your
   alignment (law/neu/cha), but this effect is blocked if you are
   pious.  The main upshot of this is that early (pre-quest) alignment
   conversion no longer makes the game unwinnable, although it is
   still a significant inconvenience, since you will need to fight the
   Wizard before doing the quest, which is not the usual strategy.

 * The shopkeeper names list for general stores has been expanded,
   since that is the most common type of shop.  Also, some tool shop
   owners have been re-inserted into the list that were in (at least
   some ports of) 3.4.3 but had been removed at some point due to the
   #ifdef purge and/or platforms being dropped.  (This re-insert was
   not comprehensive.)

 * Arrows (against small monsters) and darts have been slightly
   buffed: one additional point of base damage.

 * Cherry-picked two trap-related changes from the Gehennom Fun Patch.
   Falling rock traps are no longer generated on levels 1-3 in the
   main dungeon, and when a monster is changed by a polymorph trap,
   there is now a chance for the trap to be used up.  The probability
   of this drops off deeper into the dungeon.  To be able to use the
   same polymorph trap on pets indefinitely with no chance of it being
   used up, you must find one at dungeon level 35 or deeper.

 * Made rock piercers brown, lurkers above red.  Eventually
   these will all be in mlet t (S_TRAPPER).

 * Marked umber hulks as HI_ULINE (i.e., underlined).  This
   is a pre-emptive measure, done for the same reason that xorns
   are now red:  eventually both of these large, distinctive,
   deep-rock-dwelling creatures are going to be in the same
   monster class together, probably mlet X (S_XORN), and I don't
   want either of them looking exactly the same as the other
   one used to look, if it can be avoided.

 * Moved leprechauns into the S_IMP (lowercase i) mlet class.
   For detailed justification, see the changelog entry (834cebee),
   but in brief, they are mischevious but usually not outright
   dangerous spirit/faerie beings appearing with a physical body,
   playing pranks, meddling, occasionally making people's fortunes,
   and there is folklore associated with capturing them, all of
   which is also true of imps and tengu.  Additionally, they are
   diminutive in stature like imps and quasits.  This reduces the
   number of in-use map characters by one, which is a Good Thing.
   To distinguish, leprechauns are bright green and homonculi are
   now gray (previously, both were green).

 * Differentiated nymphs.  Wood nymphs are the lowest-level and
   slightly easier to deal with than before (notably, they are now
   slightly slower than the player); water nymphs are a little
   tougher, and mountain nymphs are now the highest-level and most
   difficult nymphs.  They do NOT grow up into each other.  However,
   water nymphs (barring fountain schenanighans, which are always a
   player's fault) and especially mountain nymphs should now start
   showing up a little later in the game than before; wood nymphs
   should start showing up around the same time as before.

 * Changed the colors of two monsters (xorns to red, acid blobs to
   yellow, matching yellow dragons).  This is a pre-emptive measure
   to reduce color conflicts later, when certain monster classes
   eventually get combined.  Might as well let users go ahead and
   get used to the new colors for these monsters now.

 * Unicorn horns are now a technically finite resource (unless you can
   cast cancellation).  Cursed unicorn horns and the "Nothing happens"
   case are unchanged.

 * The formula for the player's odds of hitting monsters has been
   adjusted significantly.  Luck and experience level are now only
   added in on a logarithmic scale (together), meaning that always
   hitting everything no matter what is (hopefully) no longer a
   foregone conclusion in the late game.  It is to be expected that
   further tweaks to this formula will be required.

 * Disabled the "network MOTD" feature, since it requires a public
   server, which Fourk currently does not have.

 * Alignment record points are no longer granted for killing most
   kinds of monsters.

 * Gaining alignment record points through sacrifice is now somewhat
   more difficult (especially for non-chaotics); although certain
   kinds of special-cased corpses are still particularly effective.

 * Alignment record now starts at 10 for lawfuls, 15 for neutrals,
   20 for chaotics.  (These numbers may get adjusted later, not sure;
   as it stands, it means chaotics don't have to improve their record
   at all to go on the quest; lawfuls must improve it by 10.)  For
   now, the role-specific differences in starting alignment have been
   evened out; this may change later, as part of role differentiation,
   but I want to get the basic balance figured out first.

 * The chance for an engraving to be successfully written exactly as
   intended, rather than in a pre-eroded form, now starts higher than
   in 3.4.3 but falls off if you write Elbereth too many times.  The
   number of times you can write Elbereth and still keep a good chance
   of writing things successfully is proportional to experience level
   and is also somewhat better for forms of engraving that use up
   resources.  Players who use Elbereth sparingly in emergencies are
   likely to notice a positive effect on its reliability (if they know
   enough not to smudge it after writing it, write one at a time,
   etc.); players who abuse Elbereth extensively will definitely
   notice that it is less reliable now.  Failure is accompanied by
   messages about your body_part(HAND) cramping up.

 * To compensate for the reduced death drops as you kill many monsters
   of the same kind (which happens in normal play for some monsters,
   particularly common ones generated in groups), the base death drop
   probability has been adjusted upward.  Thus, the first few monsters
   you kill of any given type are now more likely to leave death drops
   than before.  This needs play testing for balance, but the
   intention is that the overall number of death drops in a typical
   normal (non-farming) game should be about the same.

 * Any given type of monster becomes less likely to drop corpses and
   death drops as you kill more and more of them.  Somewhere around 80
   kills you stop getting death drops from that type of monster, and
   somewhere around 225 kills, you stop getting corpses for that kind
   of monster.  This is expected to be most noticeable with puddings
   but may also be relevant for extinctionists and throne farmers.
   I'd have made it top out at a thousand or so kills, but the kill
   count only goes up to 255, probably so it can fit in a single byte.
   In any case, this is unlikely to be noticed in normal play except
   with large creatures such as dragons, which are no longer
   guaranteed to drop corpses every single time.

 * Updated branding, docs, build rules, and such to refer to nhfourk
   (for filenames) and NetHack Fourk (for human-readable names) where
   appropriate.  References to NetHack 4 and nethack4 have also been
   retained in many places, since that is the upstream codebase on
   which NetHack Fourk is based.

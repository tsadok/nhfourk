▒▒▒   4.3.0.4 :
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Poison spikes crash bug, see #hardfought log from 2017 Apr 11, starting at 15:14 and up to about 15:30 or so.
▒▒▒   
▒▒▒ * 22:00 <         Tangles > jonadab: I found a shk bug in fourk (which was probably also inherited from vanilla).
▒▒▒   22:00 <             FIQ > what bug
▒▒▒   22:01 <         Tangles > In a hardware store, if you drop a sack, you can sell it for 1zm, but retain possession of the
▒▒▒                             non-tool items in the sack.
▒▒▒   22:01 <         Tangles > but...
▒▒▒   22:02 <         Tangles > when the shk runs out of gold, you instead trade the sack, for 1zm of credit, and the shk
▒▒▒                             takes oqnership of everything in it.
▒▒▒   22:03 <         Tangles > so when you pick it up again, you suddenly owe the shk thousands, and the last hour you spent
▒▒▒                             credit-cloning is wasted :(
▒▒▒   22:03 <             FIQ > ais523: ^ possibly in NH4 as well
▒▒▒   22:04 <          ais523 > hmm, interesting
▒▒▒   22:04 <          ais523 > that might be a vanilla bug
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 20:10 <             FIQ > jonadab: shouldn't prayer sanity checks run *before* breaking the conduct?
▒▒▒   ...
▒▒▒   This is about refusing to attempt to pray to a non-chaotic god if you are a demon.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ says he shot a watchman in the face because f1<direction> fired two darts.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Find a way to compile on Windows.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * You are now wearing a leather jacket.  The suit will not fit on your body.  (Gnome)
▒▒▒   + Preliminary attempts to reproduce this have failed (but uncovered another bug, which I fixed).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Increase the retry count on VS placement, try to make it not put the VS too close to the map edge.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Your conscience should not "bother you a little less" if your alignment
▒▒▒   record is as high as it has ever been.  Change the wording in that case.
▒▒▒   Perhaps "You feel somewhat more [lawful/neutral/chaotic]."
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Can mindless things sleep?  WHY can mindless things sleep?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Scurriers versus shop walls.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 22:06 <         Tangles > Error: Couldn't load "garden-2.lev" - making a maze.
▒▒▒   I absolutely cannot reproduce this here.  Both versions of the garden work as intended here.
▒▒▒   Additionally, Travis does not report any unexpected problems building them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 10:37 <         Tangles > Some observations... Combat messages sometimes refer to you in the
▒▒▒                             3rd person "the dwarf thrusts his dagger at the valkyrie".
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 08:36 < FIQ > jonadab: you screwed up the ordering of parameters in turn undead instadeath
▒▒▒   08:36 < FIQ > it kills the user, rather than the target
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Find some way to compile on Windows, even if it involves Cygwin and exotic dependencies.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Throwing food at a starving tame monster should not revert it to peaceful.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Audit impact_drop(), the code wherein objects fall down stairs when
▒▒▒   a thrown object hits the pile.  We think there may be at least
▒▒▒   two bugs in it.  For details, see the log of #nhfourk from
▒▒▒   2016 May 13th, starting at 8:30am.  Pay special attention to
▒▒▒   what we noticed around 9:31.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ says the nasty() message in MGC_SUMMON_MON is redundant and results in
▒▒▒   the duplicated message that has been reported.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ says a 60zm scroll in a shop that isn't marked up should auto-ID.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Wiz quest text refers to a chest on wiz home that no longer exists.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Monster-carrying-egg crash.  Steps to reproduce: 1. wish for a trice egg.
▒▒▒   2. drop it on a stair.  3. genesis a hill orc.  4. get it to pick up the egg.
▒▒▒   5. make the hill orc escape via the stairs.  6. levelport to follow.  segfault.
▒▒▒   Haven't verified whether this is Fourk-specific.  FIQ did a workaround to
▒▒▒   convert this from segfault to panic(), but we should fix it for real.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Currently, do.c hardcodes the arrival-from-below region for the terminus.
▒▒▒   This is bad and not at all what I want.  Fix it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check whether the monster-carrying-egg crash is Fourk-specific, maybe
▒▒▒   cherry-pick the workaround to 4.3-maint.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ says it's possible to bloat yourself so much you get faster.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Why do poisoned ya get the wrong plural?  http://i.imgur.com/D5vsbwA.png
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Should commit 048af5eb19a2 be in #ifdef PUBLIC_SERVER ?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒   4.3.0.5 :
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Figure out some way to make non-artifact crystal balls useful other than as polyfodder.
▒▒▒   
▒▒▒ * FIQ thinks Gnome darkvision should be able to see walls.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ thinks Stacked Dozen should be a prize level due to difficulty.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ suggests when pushing a boulder into (deep) water, sometimes shallow water should result.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Finally have a decent plan for mummies.  See #nethack4 log from 2017 Apr 16, 18:45-18:50
▒▒▒   
▒▒▒ * Should converting an altar grant an alignment bonus?  (hackedhead's idea)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Still need to squeeze a line or two out of the new ranger quest home, and rogue quest home.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Give elves lembas in the magic chest (FIQ's idea)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rething quaff-identification deterrents.  In particular, should potions of hallucination
▒▒▒   really last that long?  (Mandevil complained about this; it _is_ basically forever.)
▒▒▒   Should potions of polymorph be more common?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 06:30 < FIQ > jonadab: maybe cursed remove curse should remove curses by destroying the cursed items
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance initial magic chest contents.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * The game should track what price quotes you've seen for a given item type.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Grasshopper suggests club/mace/morningstar are basically the same skill, or should be.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 12:28 < FIQ > fu nfact: in fourk, sylphs at <12 constitution heal 1hp per turn in hell, at >=12 they don't heal at all
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Probably should suppress the "generate statues every time a cockatrice is
▒▒▒   generated" in cockatrice nests.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Giants should have a better base AC than humans.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the ability for giants to wield two-handed weapons in one hand.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * It appears that material-sensitive players can wield weapons made of the
▒▒▒   material in question without difficulty or consequence, provided you do
▒▒▒   not change form _while_ wielding the item.  (This is true for silver
▒▒▒   in .4, and probably upstream even, but I want to fix it in a general way,
▒▒▒   not only for silver.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make the gameplay mode option not offer challenge mode until it's unlocked.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Bug: for non-setseed games, the seed reported in the xlogfile and dumplog is
▒▒▒   not actually the seed that was used.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * new monster: stinking sphere.  A sphere that releases a small-diameter
▒▒▒   stinking cloud when it explodes.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adjusting the difficulty of some monsters.
▒▒▒   + For example, quasits should probably have their difficulty number reduced.
▒▒▒   + 
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow two-handed weapons to be enchanted to +10?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Enchanting a weapon to +5 or higher should identify its enchantment level.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Ensure that runics interact reasonably with stacking.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make it possible to trigger traps by throwing objects onto them.
▒▒▒   + arrow/dart trap: 
▒▒▒   + falling rock trap: a rock falls
▒▒▒   + squeaky board: if the object is heavy enough, you hear a sound
▒▒▒   + bear trap: sets off the trap (equivalent to untrapping it)
▒▒▒   + land mine: explosion, of course (the object gets blown to a new location)
▒▒▒   + rolling boulder trap: duh
▒▒▒   + sleeping gas trap: flavor text and reveal if you can see the trap tile
▒▒▒   + rust trap: water damage the object
▒▒▒   + fire trap: fire damage the object
▒▒▒   + pit, spiked pit: object lands in pit, reveal pit
▒▒▒   + hole, trap door: object falls through
▒▒▒   + vibrating square: object vibrates if you can perceive it
▒▒▒   + teleportation trap: object teleports
▒▒▒   + level teleporter: object is levelported
▒▒▒   + magic portal: object goes through to other level
▒▒▒   + web: object gets stuck
▒▒▒   + statue trap: statue comes to life
▒▒▒   + magic trap: ?
▒▒▒   + anti-magic field: if object is magical, umm, ?
▒▒▒   + polymorph trap: object is polymorphed; chance of using up the trap
▒▒▒   + stinking cloud trap: duh
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make chameleons' ability to hold their form depend on how close it is to being
▒▒▒   level-appropriate:  short duration if it's much too high or low, longer if it's close.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance spellbook frequency (now that the spellbook polymorph bug is fixed).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check the case of cursed-confused enchant armor on scaled armor.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check the case of enchanting scales with no body armor under, while unchanging.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make sure blindness is handled correctly in read.c when applying sales to armor.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Runics: ensure that differently-runic items don't stack.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide whether to implement some or all of my Alchemy proposal.  For feedback,
▒▒▒   https://www.reddit.com/r/nethack/comments/5e1taf/request_for_comments_solventsolute_alchemy/
▒▒▒   See also rgrn and my logs from #nethack-dev starting on 2016-Nov-20.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * See lycanthropy discussion from 2016 Oct 25 in #nethack-dev, culminating
▒▒▒   around 20:00.  Short version:  make transformations happen less often,
▒▒▒   and make you invulnerable for a few turns after turning back to human,
▒▒▒   flavored as a fear effect.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * "thunderous voice booms through the caverns" could benefit from some
▒▒▒   conditional logic, e.g., outdoor levels should not be called caverns,
▒▒▒   nor likely should mazes...
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Fix the bug wherein going into the options causes crashes.
▒▒▒   (This is believed to be related to achievement unlocking.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make sure monsters can't wear armor too large or small for them.
▒▒▒   (Not sure if boots and cloaks and gloves are handled yet.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Give each item a generation LEVEL, in addition to its frequency.
▒▒▒   Set it up so that the absolute value of the difference between an
▒▒▒   item's level and the current dungeon level determines the probability
▒▒▒   that mkobj (when deciding what to make at random) will reroll.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Run the testbench and fix whatever it finds.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Fix all those format warnings.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make pickup_thrown (at least optionally) work when autopickup is off otherwise.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When hallucinating, statues should appear to be monsters.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Makedefs must die.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * If the Amulet is going to suppress your teleport control, shouldn't it also
▒▒▒   prevent teleportitis from randomly kicking in at odd times?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look into the "A a boulder bounces" bug (probably channelization-related).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Figure out what further buffs to do to martial arts, if any.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Add bears.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Create multiple versions of Delphi, with minor subtle differences.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Expand the number of versions of the Labyrinth just above the Castle.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Add a couple new versions of the Garden.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Expand the numbers of versions of Yeenoghu's and Dispater's lairs.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Dream up another couple versions of Mine's End.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance spellbook prevalance in light of the C343-149 fix.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make pickup_thrown able to work when autopickup is off otherwise.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * K-Mod commits I might consider cherry picking:
▒▒▒   + Consider: d0c9cf1f691f (shopkeepers pick up gold they step onto)
▒▒▒   + Resistance vs Immunity, see also (part of) fac2c6dd7dd for poison res.
▒▒▒   + Two-weapon balance issues, see c20d51ca1c152cd7.
▒▒▒   + Two-handed weapon balance, see 4ff7364914cb46
▒▒▒   + Minor pickup_thrown bug, see dfddd28fdff213
▒▒▒   + Monster balance.  Balrog buff, see c4d52d7a9bf4a
▒▒▒   + Lava, see also 0580753ef5983, 56f511b72c36d
▒▒▒   + Items shouldn't spawn on holes, see 6381113dd84ba7
▒▒▒   + Player HP regen, consider 4ff7364914cb46 and maybe tweak.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Separate Def into distinct Arm (Armor) and Ev (Evasiveness) stats.
▒▒▒   Make Ev your chance to avoid being hit at all, and make Arm just be damage reduction.
▒▒▒   Some (heavy) armor would have an Ev penalty, so it's a trade-off; enchantment might reduce this?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the Middle Gehennom generator and Fire Pits.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Figure out which letter to clear for golems.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider implementing a couple of plants.  Look at the
▒▒▒   ones in dnethack and pick out the most interesting.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Are all the q really distinctive enough to stay?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * There really ought to be a second viable strategy (other than reflection)
▒▒▒   for dealing with an early black dragon.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Find a way to make zombies interesting, even if it's
▒▒▒   unbalanced and terrible and wrong.  They've been boring
▒▒▒   for too long, and we must overcome the inertia.  Maybe
▒▒▒   it'll be easier to steer them once they're moving.
▒▒▒   See discussion in #nhfourk from 2017 Feb 05, starting 06:58
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Do something about mummies.  See discussion in #nhfourk
▒▒▒   2017 Feb 05, starting 7:01
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement alternate versions of more special levels,
▒▒▒   including the Sanctum.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the nethack-mapgen-lower-mines-with-closets.pl algorithm.
▒▒▒   Use it sometimes (maybe 1/3) in deep Mines levels (last 2-3 levels
▒▒▒   before Mine's End).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Squeeze lines out of rogue quest home, ranger quest home.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement banshees
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Replace scroll of food detection with scroll of silence.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making monsters more likely to generate asleep
▒▒▒   if they are higher-level (relative to your current monster
▒▒▒   level generation difficulty figure).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Fine-tune the balance of sleep, including Valerian, and
▒▒▒   of stealth.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider changing the 18->18/**->25 progression for Str.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider using the L Town generator (297 on Bilious) to
▒▒▒   generate the Black Market, perhaps.
▒▒▒   
▒▒▒ * Consider making the Mines below Minetown generate items
▒▒▒   of slightly higher quality than above Minetown.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Track how much gold is generated, and diminish the amounts
▒▒▒   generated as the total increases.  Be stingier with monster
▒▒▒   inventory gold than floor gold (because the number of levels
▒▒▒   is strictly limited).  Consider also tracking the ultimate
▒▒▒   fate of gold by category (held by monsters, sitting on the
▒▒▒   ground somewhere, in a container, destroyed, etc.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Fine tune the balance on the Pw regen formula, especially
▒▒▒   as regards Sylphs.  See discussion in #nhfourk from Sunday,
▒▒▒   Feburary 5th, starting at 7:13, don't miss the late part
▒▒▒   of the discussion around 7:40.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make being stormprone work on monsters.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Giants should wield even two-handed weapons in one hand.  "You heft
▒▒▒   the mighty [weapon] in your hand.  Yes, that will do."  If it then
▒▒▒   gets cursed, it's welded to the hand, but the other hand is free.
▒▒▒   They can even use a shield in the other hand (but probably not
▒▒▒   another weapon, and certainly not another two-hander).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When a shopkeeper pushes another monster out of the doorway in order to stand in it
▒▒▒   himself to block the player, he always calls the monster "scum", regardless of what
▒▒▒   kind of monster it is.  shk.c line 3656.  Investigate whether this can be improved.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Also, in 3.6, pay_for_damage() checks to see if the shopkeeper is an animal, and
▒▒▒   takes this into account in various ways.  Investigate whether I ought to cherry-pick
▒▒▒   some or all of that fix; if so, note that 5bb3e0142, already cherry-picked, interacts with it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement sirens and banshees.  Place sirens in the Garden.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Import Aphrodite from a variant that has her, for her statue in the Garden.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * teach body_part about "teeth" (and fix the TODO in sounds.c).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at DynaHack's skill progress bars.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding a page to Ctrl-x with information about what
▒▒▒   is good and bad for your alignment record given your current
▒▒▒   race/role/alignment combination.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider, and if necessary tweak, the balance of speed.
▒▒▒   Also, make intrinsic and extrinsic and temporary speed stack
▒▒▒   for monsters, same as for players.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check whether the "You hear" part of the Valley arrival message checks deafness.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Put serious thought into giving the negative potions more uses than
▒▒▒   blanking.  After midgame, you always have far more holy water than you
▒▒▒   have any real use for, because far too many potions have no other real
▒▒▒   use.  This takes away the need for the player to decide how to use
▒▒▒   resources: you just blank all the useless potions and bless everything
▒▒▒   that could conceivably benefit from being blessed.  This should remain
▒▒▒   a possible strategy, but there should be other reasonable options.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance body armor ACs and weights.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When stuck in lava, levitation should prevent you from sinking in any deeper.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making early-game poison instadeath, when you're too low-level
▒▒▒   to have a level drained, drain other stats instead, like HP, PW, Str, Con.
▒▒▒   FIQ says divine anger does this.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ says that if you're level-drained below XL1, you can get something like
▒▒▒   "The vampire hits!  Do you want your possessions identified? [ynq]"
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Eliminate the "snake" monster.  Consolidate water moccasins into pit vipers.
▒▒▒   Ensure none of the snakes are using red, black, or yellow as their color.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * The lostalign conduct may have a bug: do_wear.c changes u.ualign.record,
▒▒▒   setting it to -1, for helm of opposite alignment, without breaking the conduct.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Peaceful monsters encountering a player-made trap should not become
▒▒▒   angry if the trap can't have any impact on them (e.g., flying over
▒▒▒   a hole, spiders on webs).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Perhaps cursed gain level should simply deposit you on the down stairs
▒▒▒   (of the level above) if you have the Amulet.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Improve the spoilers for playable races and roles, even if it means
▒▒▒   having a section written by hand.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at dnethack's skill progress indicators.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Haste self should give permanent, not temporary, speed.  Perhaps
▒▒▒   intrinsic at low skill levels, extrinsic or both at high levels.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * After some players play .4 a bit, decide if the speed formulae
▒▒▒   require further revision for balance.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Reconsider unicorn horns.  Why do they heal raven blinding?  Why
▒▒▒   do they completely trivialize restore ability?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adjusting the naming formula for randomly-named positively
▒▒▒   enchanted weapons.  hackedhead argues that "sword named Sword of Virtue"
▒▒▒   is terrible, breaks the fourth wall, doesn't scan right, and any other
▒▒▒   negative thing he can think of to say about it.  Admittedly, I can see
▒▒▒   how "a sword named Virtue" could be considered better.  Consider.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Evaluate whether chest traps need to be rebalanced.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Racial-weapon chest contents (e.g., dwarvish spears if you are a dwarf)
▒▒▒   should probably be substituted out for something else if you are
▒▒▒   restricted in the corresponding skill.  For example, a Dwa Arc gets
▒▒▒   dwarvish spears but is restricted in them.  Either that, or else this:
▒▒▒   09:56 <      hackedhead > no. i mean, for every racial weapons that exists, the relevant
▒▒▒                             should be allowed to reach basic in the corresponding skill
▒▒▒   09:57 <      hackedhead > so dwarves should be able to reach basic in spear, short sword.
▒▒▒   09:57 <      hackedhead > orcs: dagger, spear, bow
▒▒▒   09:57 <      hackedhead > elves: dagger, spear, bow, broadsword
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Really, really ought to figure out how to make it so a special (.des) level's
▒▒▒   max x and y coords can be smaller than ROWNO and COLNO.  Levels that need this
▒▒▒   include the Castle (else you can bypass), Yeenoghu's (ditto), Dispater's (ditto),
▒▒▒   Creektown (with large ROWNO, the creek stops abruptly; with large COLNO, the
▒▒▒   pieces don't fit goether correctly), and probably some others.  Additionally,
▒▒▒   the BingeHack castles and one of the 3.6 Medusa levels trigger a place_lregion
▒▒▒   bug, and limiting their size might solve that too.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the monster-vs-monster side of passive displace (jitterbug), and maybe
▒▒▒   the monster-vs-player side as well (if I can think of a way to test that).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Quasits are still boring.  Do something.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make mvm and uvm poison instandeath work like mvp poison instadeath.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Give scurriers a movement point rebate when moving onto a tree tile.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 16:51 < FIQ > jonadab: your method of exposing traps with magic mapping will not work correctly on plane of water
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the Druid role.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Should orcs have hooves, rather than feet?  (If so, should they be able to wear boots?)
▒▒▒   Should they have snouts, rather than noses?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Report various levels of speed (including being slowed, or slowed and
▒▒▒   hasted, etc) reasonably in both enlightenment and end-of-game dumps.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Perhaps randomly-generated spellbooks should be biased toward low
▒▒▒   spell levels if generated on a low dungeon level.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make strange object m (in an otherwise unused color), then repurpose their
▒▒▒   former symbol for instruments.  Rework tools to avoid reusing colors more
▒▒▒   than is necessary.  FIQ has a start (which doesn't split off instruments
▒▒▒   and so probably needs tweaking), q.v. below.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 08:12 < FIQ > jonadab, certain forms of resistances should be foolproof in challenge mode too...
▒▒▒   08:12 < FIQ > e.g. taking fire damage as a fire vortex makes no sense
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * grep the codebase for TODO comments and deal with some of them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Jackals won't wade into shallow water to reach and attack me.  _Maybe_
▒▒▒   that's ok for jackals, but check that it doesn't happen for larger foes.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * For 4.3.0.4, I bumped monster HP regen from every 20 turns to every 8
▒▒▒   turns (commit 61efee7b811a93).  After .4 gets some play testing, evaluate
▒▒▒   whether this is enough (see FIQ's comments lower down about pets attacking
▒▒▒   floating eyes).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make trollsbane turn gremlins to dust.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make dipping any negatively-enchanted thing in a potion of restore ability
▒▒▒   bring it up to +0.  Including unicorn horns.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Do a fresh batch of new Oracle and/or fortune cookie hints about new features,
▒▒▒   and review the existing ones for continued accuracy.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide what to do about hidden corridors and secret doors.  (Lots of ideas below.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make lenses grant automatic searching when worn.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider cherry-picking pool rooms from Dyna, and look at its special levels.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Do a bunch of playtesting with steeds.  If they die all the time, figure out
▒▒▒   what to do about that.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Test using the PYEC to unlock stuff, see comments below.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow fireproof scrolls to be wished for, and make them actually
▒▒▒   fireproof.  Ensure that blanking/writing don't alter their fireproof
▒▒▒   status.  Decide whether to allow creating them by any other means.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow any random object to be fooproofed when wielded, using a scroll
▒▒▒   of enchant weapon, in the same way as it is done for a weapon.
▒▒▒   Fooproofed items should be entirely protected from elemental damage
▒▒▒   (wetting/blanking, shock, fire, cold, etc.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make some (limited) armor that gnomes and scurriers can wear;
▒▒▒   consider doing the same for giants.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement dress shirts, give them to librarians.  Consider what other
▒▒▒   equipment they should get.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding a ring of speed, as an alternative to speed boots.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Keep stats on how many game turns are spent on various multi-turn
▒▒▒   activities (digging, for instance).  Dumplog it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When rings go down a sink, something about the message ought to hint at the possibility of recovery.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make potions of oil a bit more common, or put them in some monster's
▒▒▒   starting inventory, or something, so they can be used for weapon repair.
▒▒▒   Or introduce pools of oil so potions can be #dip-converted to oil.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make sure troll corpses aren't too old to eat before they're too old to revive.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make some weapon skills harder to learn than others, either in terms of
▒▒▒   practice required, or skill points invested, or both.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make katanas use a different skill from long swords.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Test attacking floating eyes as a raven, for message weirdness.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the autounlock feature as in DynaHack.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow hezrou to see through and in stinking clouds.  (Maybe give them intrinsic astral vision?)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look into probing schrodinger's cat (see comments below).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Add xlog and dumplog tracking for how many turns you suffered various
▒▒▒   status effects (blindness, hallucination, confusion, stunning), similar
▒▒▒   to conduct tracking but in a separate field.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make charged ring of searching increase your search radius.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make Valerian less OP somehow.  Perhaps sleep is too OP.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at how the lamp charging code manages to allow charging a lit
▒▒▒   lamp; use a similar toechnique to fix the issue of lit candles
▒▒▒   being impervious to fire damage.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Helm of Opposite Alignment should never be given as a sacrifice gift, ever.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider guaranteeing a pick-axe in the Mines somewhere.  Maybe in Minetown.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Really really should enable highlighting of peacefuls to be disabled
▒▒▒   without turning off highlighting of pets.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide whether to cherry-pick the vampire shapeshifter stuff (sans wolves)
▒▒▒   from the 3.6 series, with all its bug fixes, A) now, B) later, or C) never.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * dnethack limits the number of pets you can keep to Charisma/3.  Consider
▒▒▒   whether something like this might be good (and maybe some roles or races
▒▒▒   should get a bonus, or take careful note of healer cha at least).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider how the Staff of Aesculalialdkjlaius should work for Sylphs.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the infrastructure for runic weapons:
▒▒▒   + Runics can be wished for in wizmode only.
▒▒▒   + Randomly generated weapons that are allowed to be artifacts but the
▒▒▒     RNG doesn't make them such, get a second chance to be runic instead.
▒▒▒     Any given weapon can have at most one rune.  Most have none, obviously.
▒▒▒   + Possible runes might include:
▒▒▒     - rune of fire (provides fire res when wielded; does fire damage; when dipped in shallow water, evaporates it)
▒▒▒     - rune of cold (provides cold res when wielded; does cold damage; when #dipped in a pool, moat, or shallow water, turns it to ice)
▒▒▒     - rune of poison (weapon is permanently poisoned and provides poison res when wielded)
▒▒▒     - rune of acid (weapon does acid damage and provides acid res when wielded and cannot be corroded)
▒▒▒     - rune of lightning (weapon does shock damage and provides shock res when wielded)
▒▒▒     - rune of accuracy (weapon never misses)
▒▒▒     - rune of peace (weapon always misses but also improves the odds that enemies/projectiles miss you, when wielded)
▒▒▒     - rune of magic (weapon does magic damage, like magic missile, and provides MR when wielded)
▒▒▒     - rune of action (weapon provides free action when wielded)
▒▒▒     - rune of blessing (weapon is permanently blessed and blocks the curse-items monster spell effect)
▒▒▒     - rune of damage (weapon does 1.5 times as much damage as it otherwise would)
▒▒▒     - rune of cancellation (weapon cancels monsters when it hits them, cancels potions when dipped in them, not using them up, except for holy/unholy water)
▒▒▒     - rune of rune of awareness (weapon grants automatic searching when wielded)
▒▒▒   + At game start, an array (probably in struct you) is populated providing a random rune appearance for
▒▒▒     each type of rune.  Identification of these is tracked: when you see a runic weapon activate, or if
▒▒▒     you formally identify one, its rune is identified.
▒▒▒     - Possible rune appearances include:
▒▒▒          glowing rune*, square rune, curved rune, angled rune, complex rune,
▒▒▒          strange rune, simple rune, elaborate rune, ornate rune, ancient rune,
▒▒▒          dwarvish rune*, gnomic rune*, dark rune, ominous rune, explicit rune,
▒▒▒          embossed rune, raised rune, seriffed rune, stylized rune, ugly rune,
▒▒▒          beautiful rune, straight rune, looping rune, unfamiliar rune, plain rune,
▒▒▒          circumscribed rune, obscure rune, gilded rune, magnificent rune, fancy rune,
▒▒▒          gaudy rune, convoluted rune, florid rune, portentious rune, grotesque rune
▒▒▒     - A weapon with a glowing rune provides light, with a small radius.
▒▒▒     - The identity of the dwarvish rune (if this appearance is assigned to a rune)
▒▒▒       is known from game start by dwarvish players.
▒▒▒     - The identity of the gnomic rune (same caveat) is known from game start by gnomish players.
▒▒▒   + Any weapon with a rune is described as "runed" normally, and the player can (attempt to) read it.
▒▒▒     (The player can also now attempt to read runed daggers, runed broadswords, and any other "runed" weapon.)
▒▒▒     - If the weapon has a rune that is known, reading the weapon tells the player something like
▒▒▒       "The rune signifies fire."
▒▒▒       This _does_ break illiterate conduct.
▒▒▒     - If the weapon has a rune that is unknown, reading the weapon tells the player something like
▒▒▒       "There is a glowing rune, but you do not know what it signifies."
▒▒▒       This does NOT break illiterate conduct.
▒▒▒     - If the weapon has no rune as such but is "runed" because Elven, and you ARE elvish by race,
▒▒▒       then reading the weapon tells the player something like this:
▒▒▒       "The runes mark this weapon as the craftsmanship of [Elven-sounding name]."
▒▒▒       This _does_ break illiterate conduct.
▒▒▒       The name of the craftsman can be determined by object ID and modular arithmetic, given a list.
▒▒▒     - If the weapon has no rune as such but is "runed" because Elven, and you are NOT elvish by race,
▒▒▒       the attempting to read the weapon tells the player something like this:
▒▒▒       "Elven runes run down the blade.  You cannot decipher their meaning."
▒▒▒       (The word "blade" may need to be %s if there are runed spears or whatnot.)
▒▒▒     - Weapons that do not have a rune and are not "runed" elven weapons cannot be read, as before.
▒▒▒   + 
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Update the guidebook.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒   Untriaged Stuff:
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make charisma have the opposite effect on shop quotes when you are
▒▒▒   both same-race and also same-gender to the shopkeeper.  (Maybe?)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 20:32 < Grasshopper_ > YANI: blessed polymorph potion allows you to choose the poly form
▒▒▒   20:54 <      jonadab > You know, as rare as those are, I think that would actually be ok.
▒▒▒   But then I remembered, polymorph is a key deterrent to quaff-identifying potions.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 13:06 < Chris_ANG > unfamilliar (and also familliar >_<) mosters turning
▒▒▒                       out to be a member of your own race has been a constant
▒▒▒                       problem in dNethack, right?
▒▒▒   13:07 < Chris_ANG > I'm going to make it so that a sufficiently-well-aligned
▒▒▒                       character gets a warning before doing something that
▒▒▒                       would result in canibalism or same-race sacrifice. 
▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒   4.3.0.6 or Later:
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Track the player's alignment record separately for each of the three alignments,
▒▒▒   so that HoOA can be handled reasonably.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Bats should be able to around corners, up to some limited number of LOS bounces (maybe 3).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Clear up remaining niggles with the Garden implementation, see the
▒▒▒   commit log notes on commit commit 302d5fa9072.  Some of this may
▒▒▒   require levcomp overhaul and so may get pushed back further.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make wielding and throwing separate skills for daggers and knives.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Instead of true/false, I want corridorbranch to be an enum:
▒▒▒      stop:  branching corridors stop movement (except targetted travel)
▒▒▒      stop_when_exploring (default): discovering a new branch stops movement;
▒▒▒                           but previously explored ones don't.
▒▒▒      keep_going: branching corridors do not interrupt movement.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Khor says, definitely look at the demon lairs in dnethack.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Move Nagas into S, freeing N for some other use.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making diagonal movement between a pit or hole and
▒▒▒   something solid (such as a wall or boulder) cause you to fall
▒▒▒   into the pit or hole.  Revise the Count Carefully Sokoban
▒▒▒   level (and rename it).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement Un-style HTML dumplogs.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider how long potions of hallucination should last, and,
▒▒▒   if those are nerfed a bit, what other quaff-identification
▒▒▒   deterrents could supplement them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider changing the 18 -> 18/** -> 25 progression for Str,
▒▒▒   see comments lower in this file about that.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding an additional option for animation, to control
▒▒▒   the duration of the delay between frames.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding some kind of consolation special level that
▒▒▒   only generates when Ludios doesn't (accessible a different way).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Think through possible uses of restore_attrib and the ability to
▒▒▒   _temporarily_ boost or penalize the users' attributes.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide what to do about Minetown rules -- monsters can freely do
▒▒▒   things that would anger the Watch if the player did them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at raisse's idea for a better Arc quest artifact,
▒▒▒   http://valdyas.org/~irina/stonecutter

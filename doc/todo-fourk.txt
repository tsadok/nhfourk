Outstanding Bug Reports:
2023 June:
 * <@cpittman> !tell jonadab Might have found a bug in fourk. I'm playing a
   barbarian with a battle axe and there's a gas spore in the arc of my swing. When
   it explodes the game crashes. I'm guessing the swing took out a monster the
   explosion would kill. There might have also been a hidden garter snake in the
   explosion. Game continues fine as long as I kill the gas spore away from any
   other monsters.  Error: dmonsfree: 3 removed doesn't match 4 pending Location:
2022 October:
 * Elf wizard players can fight with (iron) daggers and can wield (iron)
   pick axes but cannot dig because "You can't handle [iron] anymore".
   This is clearly inconsistent; need to decide how to handle it.
   Reported 2022 October on Libera.chat by msearle
2022 Jan:
 * Players see menus with only the unlocked possibilities and
   think it's a bug even after having been told about the unlock system.
   Feedback suggests the menu should indicate that there are locked entries.
   + Partly addressed (for picking a role when starting a game).
 * Config files from 4.3.0.4 and earlier can specify options that are
   currently locked in .5.  This causes just about the problems I'd expect.
   Need to reject/ignore locked options in the config file.

▒▒▒   T O D O    L i s t s  :                         ▒▒▒
▒▒▒                                                   ▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒   4.3.0.6 (before save-compat-freeze) :
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Extrinsic disint res (from black scales) should probably protect
▒▒▒   inventory in much the same way as fire, cold, and shock; i.e.,
▒▒▒   black-scaled armor should probably protect a cloak.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * A clear "This save file is from 4.3.0.5 or earlier" would be much
▒▒▒   better than the current situation with old-version saves.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * There should be an artifact two-handed sword that Bar can get,
▒▒▒   of comparable overall power to Cleaver but with different pros/cons.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the infrastructure for runic weapons:
▒▒▒   + Make runic weapons do special damage where appropriate.
▒▒▒   + Implement the runes of blessing and curse.
▒▒▒   + Implement the rune of cancellation.
▒▒▒   + Add small-radius see invisible to the rune of awareness.
▒▒▒   + Implement the rune of peace.
▒▒▒   + Test that the runics actually work.  On weapons, on armor, all the runes.
▒▒▒   + Merge the runics branch into bleeding-edge.
▒▒▒ * Ensure that runics interact reasonably with stacking.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Nuke magic cancellation.  Test late-game balance with this change.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the Druid role.  Always neutral.  Human, possibly gnome.
▒▒▒   (I'd say dwarf if they could be neutral, but changing that seems not worth it,
▒▒▒   and lawful druid seems weird to me for some reason.)
▒▒▒   https://hardfought.org/etherpad/p/Druid_Design_Discussion
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making giantslayer a sling.  The wiki says Un does this.
▒▒▒   Also, should it be the Caveman first sac gift?  Discuss.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at how the lamp charging code manages to allow charging a lit
▒▒▒   lamp; use a similar technique to fix the issue of lit candles
▒▒▒   being impervious to fire damage.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Really really should enable highlighting of peacefuls to be disabled
▒▒▒   without turning off highlighting of pets.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Put serious thought into giving the negative potions more uses than
▒▒▒   blanking.  After midgame, you always have far more holy water than you
▒▒▒   have any real use for, because far too many potions have no other real
▒▒▒   use.  This takes away the need for the player to decide how to use
▒▒▒   resources: you just blank all the useless potions and bless everything
▒▒▒   that could conceivably benefit from being blessed.  This should remain
▒▒▒   a possible strategy, but there should be other reasonable options.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 14:56 < rld > <@malor> ... request for a change is the full "YES" to confirm
▒▒▒                          attacking a peaceful :). That has gotten me a bunch because
▒▒▒                          I am often moving quickly with "y"
▒▒▒   Hmm, shouldn't attacking a peaceful require the Fight/Force prefix?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make strange object m (in an otherwise unused color), then repurpose their
▒▒▒   former symbol for instruments.  Rework tools to avoid reusing colors more
▒▒▒   than is necessary.  FIQ has a start (which doesn't split off instruments
▒▒▒   and so probably needs tweaking), q.v. in my old TODO file on warthog.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding a physician's head mirror as an armor item that can be worn
▒▒▒   by small monsters (including gnomes) and provides reflection, but no defense.
▒▒▒   Maybe make small the _maximum_ size that can wear it, so humans cannot.  Let
▒▒▒   gnomish healers start with one, to offset their dearth of other armor.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make some (limited) armor that gnomes and scurriers can wear;
▒▒▒   consider doing the same for giants.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Revisit the sacrifice gift code's fallback options for armor, to
▒▒▒   ensure it can always find something size-appropriate.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Keep stats on how many game turns are spent on various multi-turn
▒▒▒   activities (digging, for instance).  Dumplog it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Add xlog and dumplog tracking for how many turns you suffered various
▒▒▒   status effects (blindness, hallucination, confusion, stunning), similar
▒▒▒   to conduct tracking but in a separate field.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider tracking the ultimate fate of gold by category
▒▒▒   (held by monsters, sitting on the ground somewhere, in a container,
▒▒▒   eaten, destroyed, etc.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look into probing schrodinger's cat.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make charged ring of searching increase your search radius.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * dnethack limits the number of pets you can keep to Charisma/3.  Consider
▒▒▒   whether something like this might be good (and maybe some roles or races
▒▒▒   should get a bonus, or take careful note of healer cha at least).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider implementing a couple of plants.  Look at the
▒▒▒   ones in dnethack and pick out the most interesting.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * K-Mod commits I might consider cherry picking:
▒▒▒   + Resistance vs Immunity, see also (part of) fac2c6dd7dd for poison res.
▒▒▒   + Two-weapon balance issues, see c20d51ca1c152cd7.
▒▒▒   + Two-handed weapon balance, see 4ff7364914cb46
▒▒▒   + Minor pickup_thrown bug, see dfddd28fdff213
▒▒▒   + Monster balance.  Balrog buff, see c4d52d7a9bf4a
▒▒▒   + Lava, see also 0580753ef5983, 56f511b72c36d
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the Middle Gehennom generator and Fire Pits.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * < aosdict+> jonadab: This could be one of those uses for potions
▒▒▒               like sleeping: what if you could coat your ammo in sleeping
▒▒▒               potions? Instant tranquilizer darts!
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider FIQ's changes to spellbook mechanics, 5f81af2.  Be advised this will absolutely
▒▒▒   necessitate a fullwise balance check on spellbook availability.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Conducts:
▒▒▒   You never used/wore/wielded/applied/invoked/carried an artifact.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 18:48 <     FIQ+> jonadab: yani for 4k \n pegasus, a flying horse slightly higher base level than warhorse
▒▒▒                     speed 24-26 \n no special abilities other than flight
▒▒▒   18:50 < jonadab+> FIQ: That is not a bad idea.
▒▒▒   18:54 <  ais523 > would they be tameable with vegetables?
▒▒▒   18:54 <     FIQ+> I feel like it should be harder \n but preferably possible without magic
▒▒▒   18:56 <  ais523 > you could make it so that pegasi avoid getting lined up, like unicorns do
▒▒▒   18:56 <  ais523 > so actually hitting them with the vegetables is hard
▒▒▒   I could also make it so that each carrot/apple is only a percentage chance to tame them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider commit eb85596 (from dnethack), which addresses the 127 level limitation.
▒▒▒   This is not even remotely urgent for Fourk, but in principle it would be nice to
▒▒▒   not have to worry about that limit, if we decide to introduce some optional branches.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 14:01 < RLdiscord1 > <@Webmant> "you throw the dagger at the fire elemental" "the dagger shoots back at you, burning with primal flame
▒▒▒   14:02 < RLdiscord1 > <@Webmant> "The air elemental returns your dagger with a strong gust of wind
▒▒▒   14:04 < RLdiscord1 > <@Webmant> "The earth elemental adds the primal elements of the dagger to itself and becomes stronger
▒▒▒   In general, I want to add passive-versus-ranged attacks.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 12:41 < aosdict > FIQ: YANI/EPI: open doors can generate trapped (possible with my door overhaul).
▒▒▒                     Once you step off of a trapped open door, it closes and locks.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Cherry-pick FIQ's probabilty-1000 refactor, a0781683398ed and 162611e
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check whether the FIQHack object pile implementation can be cherry-picked.
▒▒▒   Commits include: 73ca6d747f82, 4d16b6c, e3e43dc, f1c7504, b583fe6, 3ae61f0
▒▒▒   Semi-related:  4cfb84b
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Finally have a decent plan for mummies.  See #nethack4 log from 2017 Apr 16, 18:45-18:50
▒▒▒   
▒▒▒ * The game should track what price quotes you've seen for a given item type.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Give each item a generation LEVEL, in addition to its frequency.
▒▒▒   Set it up so that the absolute value of the difference between an
▒▒▒   item's level and the current dungeon level determines the probability
▒▒▒   that mkobj (when deciding what to make at random) will reroll.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Separate Def into distinct Arm (Armor) and Ev (Evasiveness) stats.
▒▒▒   Make Ev your chance to avoid being hit at all, and make Arm just be damage reduction.
▒▒▒   Some (heavy) armor would have an Ev penalty, so it's a trade-off; enchantment might reduce this?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Figure out which letter to clear for golems.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider changing the 18->18/**->25 progression for Str.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement sirens.  Place sirens in the Garden.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Import Aphrodite from a variant that has her, for her statue in the Garden.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Really, really need to figure out how to make it so a special (.des) level's
▒▒▒   max x and y coords can be smaller than ROWNO and COLNO.  Levels that need this
▒▒▒   include the Castle (else you can bypass), Yeenoghu's (ditto), Dispater's (ditto),
▒▒▒   Creektown (with large ROWNO, the creek stops abruptly; with large COLNO, the
▒▒▒   pieces don't fit goether correctly), and probably some others.  Additionally,
▒▒▒   the BingeHack castles and one of the 3.6 Medusa levels trigger a place_lregion
▒▒▒   bug, and limiting their size might solve that too.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 21:18 < FIQ > jonadab: you should make a flying monster with a displacement attack
▒▒▒   21:18 < FIQ > and have them like using it over water or traps
▒▒▒   Or a swimming monster with a displacement attack.  Or amphibious.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * grep the codebase for TODO comments and deal with some of them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide what to do about hidden corridors and secret doors.  (Lots of ideas below.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement dress shirts, give them to librarians.  Consider what other
▒▒▒   equipment they should get.  Books?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding a ring of speed, as an alternative to speed boots.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider introducing pools of oil so potions can be #dip-converted to oil.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make Valerian (and sleep in general) less OP somehow.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Currently, do.c hardcodes the arrival-from-below region for the terminus.
▒▒▒   This is bad and not at all what I want.  Fix it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 14:44 < FIQ > jonadab: when I was new to nethack
▒▒▒   14:44 < FIQ > I used to think that luck was a lot more complicated than what it actually is
▒▒▒   14:45 < FIQ > due to the enlightenment message for uncursed luckstones
▒▒▒   14:45 < FIQ > basically, I thought you had both "good luck" and "bad luck"
▒▒▒   14:45 < FIQ > which could cancel each other out, but was still 2 seperate scales
▒▒▒   14:45 < FIQ > and thus if you had any bad luck, you'd be unable to max out your luck
▒▒▒   14:45 < FIQ > until it timed out
▒▒▒   14:46 < FIQ > blessing your luckstone would be more important
▒▒▒   14:47 < FIQ > since otherwise, your rare cases of bad luck (mirrors, killing a peaceful before angering, etc)
▒▒▒   14:47 < FIQ > would accumulate
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at FIQ's ace9e3ba, which adds when-worn properties to several
▒▒▒   tools and also makes some interesting changes to cameras.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 16:51 < FIQ > jonadab: your method of exposing traps with magic mapping
▒▒▒   will not work correctly on plane of water
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement banshees
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Find a way to make zombies interesting, even if it's
▒▒▒   unbalanced and terrible and wrong.  They've been boring
▒▒▒   for too long, and we must overcome the inertia.  Maybe
▒▒▒   it'll be easier to steer them once they're moving.
▒▒▒   See discussion in #nhfourk from 2017 Feb 05, starting 06:58

▒▒▒   Things that can happen AFTER a save-compat freeze:
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Finish implementing the scroll of silence.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 10:45 < FIQ > jonadab: 8ff02c11d9979497396d4921bf0d7cf81808c5d1 3.6.1 commit might be relevant for you
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Monsters with the M3_CLIMBER flag should be able to get out of pits in one turn.
▒▒▒   Also double-check that M1_FLY is handled correctly.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Unset lev->heardsound[foo] whenever a level feature is destroyed,
▒▒▒   also when a shopkeeper or aligned priest is killed or taken off-level.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * For 4.3.0.4, I bumped monster HP regen from every 20 turns to every 8
▒▒▒   turns (commit 61efee7b811a93).  After .4 gets some play testing, evaluate
▒▒▒   whether this is enough (see FIQ's comments lower down about pets attacking
▒▒▒   floating eyes).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 08:56 <     rld > <@Ann> i think priests should have names just like shopkeepers
▒▒▒   11:07 < jonadab > That's a good idea.
▒▒▒   11:07 < jonadab > With distinct name pools for each alignment.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Monsters with the M3_CLIMBER flag, and scurriers, should be able to enter tree tiles.
▒▒▒   Scurriers should get a movement-points discount when doing so.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * The M3_CLIMBER flag should change the message when you go up ladders or stairs.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look through the Shieldmaiden/Hoplite quest text and rework/reflavor it
▒▒▒   if needed (you may be coming to the aid of a group of warriors foreign to you;
▒▒▒   doing so at the behest of the Norn still makes flavor sense).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look through the Shieldmaiden/Hoplite quest text and rework/reflavor it
▒▒▒   if needed (you may be coming to the aid of a group of warriors foreign to you;
▒▒▒   doing so at the behest of the Norn still makes flavor sense).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Create multiple versions of Delphi, with minor subtle differences.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Expand the number of versions of the Labyrinth just above the Castle,
▒▒▒   and make them more distinct from each other in some way (not the maze
▒▒▒   portion, but the special parts).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Expand the numbers of versions of Yeenoghu's and Dispater's lairs.
▒▒▒   Or better yet, carry through on the original plans for randomness
▒▒▒   within them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make pickup_thrown (at least optionally) work when autopickup is off otherwise.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider whether any very fast monsters need a (difficulty) bump because of that.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Redo the colors for the Dawnlike tiles for all the keys,
▒▒▒   and maybe the violet potion as well.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * The comment above findgold() says it can search containers, but currently it
▒▒▒   does not actually do so.  Look at everywhere it's called and make a decision on
▒▒▒   whether it should search containers or not; change either the code or the comment.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * It seems the artifact spoiler doesn't support SPFX stuff.  Make it so it does.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Reconsider unicorn horns.  Why do they heal raven blinding?  Why
▒▒▒   do they completely trivialize restore ability?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow martial arts users to break boulders bare-handed.
▒▒▒   See EvilHack commit f03ad32ba1937a
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Per discussion in #hardfought on 2017 Apr 28, 7:38-7:47 am:
▒▒▒   + Make "You begin bashing monsters with your [nonweapon]" force more
▒▒▒     by default, if it doesn't already.  (Did this part 2017 August 25.)
▒▒▒   + Introduce a similar message for when you attack a monster with
▒▒▒     a weapon you're not skilled in.  Make the wording stronger if you
▒▒▒     are restricted than if merely unskilled.  Make it happen once on
▒▒▒     first hit, then not repeat until you wield again.
▒▒▒   + Make that message also force more by default, if not tab.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make the ais-enhanced A command that players can't figure out how to use die in a fire.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Hallucination should make umber hulk and medusa gazes ineffective and should
▒▒▒   block all touch-of-death (not just Death's).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make red scales grant fire resistance and sliming resistance.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at and consider cherry-picking FIQ's unskilled bashmsh, 7ad158a
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make the Wizard's Tower dragon hall have all colors of D.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Potions shouldn't be destroyed by fire attacks (because they're destroyed by cold attacks,
▒▒▒   and the player should be able to protect them with a single extrinsic resistance).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 02:06 #hardfought: <  LarienTelrunya > !tell jonadab at least in the bleeding-edge version of nethack fourk,
▒▒▒                                          "Dancing with Demiliches" medusa level gives two wands to one demilich and
▒▒▒                                           none to the other; not sure if that's a mistake, but I wanted to point it out :)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Limit a crystal ball's effective search radius based on intelligence.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 19:12 < FIQ > and ea76623be59adb32f24c1c4b197cc6815deab611
▒▒▒   This contains two things.  The one Fourk probably wants has to do with bags of holding auto-identifying
▒▒▒   when used.  Since object weights are shown, that makes sense on the InterHack Principle.
▒▒▒   The other half has to do with gaining/losing a property (regeneration, as it happens), and since
▒▒▒   a lot of property-related stuff is reworked in FIQHack I'd be hesitant to just blindly apply
▒▒▒   that part to Fourk, without carefully checking for implications.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ thinks Gnome darkvision should be able to see walls.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ suggests when pushing a boulder into (deep) water, sometimes shallow water should result.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Still need to squeeze a line or two out of the new ranger quest home, and rogue quest home.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Give elves lembas in the magic chest (FIQ's idea)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rethink quaff-identification deterrents.  In particular, should potions of hallucination
▒▒▒   really last that long?  (Mandevil complained about this; it _is_ basically forever.)
▒▒▒   Should potions of polymorph be more common?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Can mindless things sleep?  WHY can mindless things sleep?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 06:30 < FIQ > jonadab: maybe cursed remove curse should remove curses by destroying the cursed items
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance initial magic chest contents.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Grasshopper suggests club/mace/morningstar are basically the same skill, or should be.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Probably should suppress the "generate statues every time a cockatrice is
▒▒▒   generated" in cockatrice nests.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make it possible to trigger traps by throwing objects onto them.
▒▒▒   + arrow/dart trap: an arrow or dart shoots out in a random direction
▒▒▒   + falling rock trap: a rock falls
▒▒▒   + squeaky board: if the object is heavy enough, you hear a sound
▒▒▒   + bear trap: sets off the trap (equivalent to untrapping it)
▒▒▒   + land mine: explosion, of course (the object gets blown to a new location)
▒▒▒   + rolling boulder trap: duh
▒▒▒   + sleeping gas trap: flavor text and reveal if you can see the trap tile
▒▒▒   + rust trap: water damage the object
▒▒▒   + fire trap: fire damage the object
▒▒▒   + pit, spiked pit: object lands in pit, reveal pit
▒▒▒   + hole, trap door: object falls through, reveal trap door
▒▒▒   + vibrating square: object vibrates (reveal if you can perceive it)
▒▒▒   + teleportation trap: object teleports
▒▒▒   + level teleporter: object is levelported
▒▒▒   + magic portal: object goes through to other level
▒▒▒   + web: object gets stuck (this is purely flavor)
▒▒▒   + statue trap: statue comes to life
▒▒▒   + magic trap: ?
▒▒▒   + anti-magic field: if object is magical, umm, ?
▒▒▒   + polymorph trap: object is polymorphed; chance of using up the trap
▒▒▒   + stinking cloud trap: duh
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance spellbook frequency (now that the spellbook polymorph bug is fixed).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check the case of cursed-confused enchant armor on scaled armor.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check the case of enchanting scales with no body armor under, while unchanging.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make sure blindness is handled correctly in read.c when applying sales to armor.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Runics: ensure that differently-runic items don't stack.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Run the testbench and fix whatever it finds.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance spellbook prevalance.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Squeeze lines out of rogue quest home, ranger quest home.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making monsters more likely to generate asleep
▒▒▒   if they are higher-level (relative to your current monster
▒▒▒   level generation difficulty figure).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Fine-tune the balance of sleep, including Valerian, and
▒▒▒   of stealth.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider using the L Town generator (297 on Bilious) to
▒▒▒   generate the Black Market, perhaps.
▒▒▒   
▒▒▒ * Consider making the Mines below Minetown generate items
▒▒▒   of slightly higher quality than above Minetown.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When a shopkeeper pushes another monster out of the doorway in order to stand in it
▒▒▒   himself to block the player, he always calls the monster "scum", regardless of what
▒▒▒   kind of monster it is.  shk.c line 3656.  Investigate whether this can be improved.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Also, in 3.6, pay_for_damage() checks to see if the shopkeeper is an animal, and
▒▒▒   takes this into account in various ways.  Investigate whether I ought to cherry-pick
▒▒▒   some or all of that fix; if so, note that 5bb3e0142, already cherry-picked, interacts with it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance body armor ACs and weights.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When stuck in lava, levitation should prevent you from sinking in any deeper.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ says that if you're level-drained below XL1, you can get something like
▒▒▒   "The vampire hits!  Do you want your possessions identified? [ynq]"
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Peaceful monsters encountering a player-made trap should not become
▒▒▒   angry if the trap can't have any impact on them (e.g., flying over
▒▒▒   a hole, spiders on webs).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adjusting the naming formula for randomly-named positively
▒▒▒   enchanted weapons.  hackedhead argues that "sword named Sword of Virtue"
▒▒▒   is terrible, breaks the fourth wall, doesn't scan right, and any other
▒▒▒   negative thing he can think of to say about it.  Admittedly, I can see
▒▒▒   how "a sword named Virtue" could be considered better.  Consider.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Evaluate whether chest traps need to be rebalanced.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the monster-vs-monster side of passive displace (jitterbug), and maybe
▒▒▒   the monster-vs-player side as well (if I can think of a way to test that).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Report various levels of speed (including being slowed, or slowed and
▒▒▒   hasted, etc) reasonably in both enlightenment and end-of-game dumps.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make trollsbane turn gremlins to dust.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make dipping any negatively-enchanted thing in a potion of restore ability
▒▒▒   bring it up to +0.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Do a bunch of playtesting with steeds.  If they die all the time, figure out
▒▒▒   what to do about that.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Test using the PYEC to unlock stuff, see comments below.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When rings go down a sink, something about the message ought to hint at the possibility of recovery.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make sure troll corpses aren't too old to eat before they're too old to revive.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Test attacking floating eyes as a raven, for message weirdness.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Helm of Opposite Alignment should never be given as a sacrifice gift, ever.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider guaranteeing a pick-axe in the Mines somewhere.  Maybe in Minetown.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Do a fresh batch of new Oracle and/or fortune cookie hints about new features,
▒▒▒   and review the existing ones for continued accuracy.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Update the guidebook.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Have a look at commits 988ee945a7d9f8506 and 271319cf6ea4ed5fe
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * @Luxcalibur says the advcal doors can be kicked down in Fourk.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * @Luxcalibur says the advcal numbers aren't in front of the doors.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 8:39 < hothraxxa > jonadab: i'm seeing an odd bug with teleportitis
▒▒▒  18:40 <   jonadab+> Oh?
▒▒▒  18:40 < hothraxxa > when it asks me if i want to be teleported, it places the cursor in some 
▒▒▒                      odd position usually well away from me
▒▒▒  18:40 < hothraxxa > no pattern that i can discern
▒▒▒  18:40 <   jonadab+> It's theoretically supposed to place the cursor in your last travel 
▒▒▒                      destination, if you are in the middle of an incomplete travel.
▒▒▒  18:41 <   jonadab+> Your location otherwise, IIRC?
▒▒▒  18:41 <   jonadab+> Perhaps the "if" part is going wrong somehow?
▒▒▒  18:41 < hothraxxa > i thought as much but it seems to persist even though i'm not ravelling 
▒▒▒                      on that level
▒▒▒  18:41 < hothraxxa > +t
▒▒▒  18:41 <   jonadab+> Hmm, maybe it has failed to notice that your incomplete travel was on a 
▒▒▒                      different level?
▒▒▒  18:41 <   jonadab+> That's a plausible oversight.
▒▒▒  18:42 < hothraxxa > could be. i could be worng but i think this a new bug
▒▒▒  18:42 <   jonadab+> I don't recall the details of how the code for that works, will have to 
▒▒▒                      find the relevant commit.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * aosdict\ito+> jonadab: major bug: I'm losing alignment (hesitating for just a moment) because
▒▒▒   some quest guardian blew up a wand nowhere near me and other guardians caught in the blast 
▒▒▒   got angered. There goes my no-alignment-penalty conduct :/
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * aosdict\ito+> FIQ: Is there any way to force the options in an existing game to be overridden
▒▒▒   by the ones set globally? I just configured my autopickup rules globally because I actually
▒▒▒   didn't last time, and now I have a game where I apparently have to do them again :/
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Quasits are still boring.  Do something.  Maybe give them a range-two tailwhip attack
▒▒▒   and have them run away (maybe even with mnitro) after doing it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Tangles reports that young dragon (Ḋ) renders double-wide on his setup.  This is
▒▒▒   obviously not desirable, need to try to track down why that is happening or what
▒▒▒   can be done about it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Jitterbugs interact meaningfully with Sokoban.  Consider.  (Thanks to tsukumogami for reporting.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 12:47 < nooodle > yani: anti-magic field traps should end magic effects such as haste self. I don't think that's evil,
▒▒▒                     seems like it would make people actually care about this otherwise pretty meaningless trap
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 08:46 < bhaak > in unnethack, you get auto-id e.g. for sleep or death if you know the other already
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Why do unicorn horns randomly do nothing half the time?  Does this serve any
▒▒▒   purpose other than requiring the player to tediously apply it repeatedly?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * LarienTelrunya > jonadab: "Yeenoghu casts a spell at you! A magic missile bounces off
▒▒▒   the samurai!" gee, the samurai is me...
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * LarienTelrunya > also this pit fiend just made a hole *on the staircase*
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 04:40 #hardfought: < LarienTelrunya > !tell jonadab [...] is it intentional that a
▒▒▒   scroll of remove curse doesn't uncurse the cursed luckstone in my open inventory?
▒▒▒   am I supposed to actually wield it to make the scroll work???
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 04:43 #hardfought: < LarienTelrunya > !tell jonadab "You destroy the lich!
▒▒▒   Something's body crumbles into dust." didn't you fix that thrice already? it
▒▒▒   still happens!
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 05:38 #hardfought: < LarienTelrunya > !tell jonadab your weird stinking cloud traps
▒▒▒   don't reveal themselves when triggered! intentional?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make elder and ancient dragons not a valid polyform.  Because chameleons.
▒▒▒   And credit LT with noticing.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 06:02 #hardfought: < LarienTelrunya > !tell jonadab " b - 36 tsurugis {60}"
▒▒▒   found on one of the samurai player monsters on the quest
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * K2 says he got "Sparks fly as you whack the boulder. The axe-handle vibrates violently!"
▒▒▒   while wielding a bullwhip and digging as a scurrier arc.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look over xnethack commit a2d98d2614ef and consider the whole table of spell
▒▒▒   school skill levels and such.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider letting most roles get Basic in more spell schools.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look over fnethack (a fork of 343-nao; I added it as a remote to my nao repo),
▒▒▒   see if it has any commits I want to cherry-pick.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Regarding spell failure rates, look at eecdabc and 0245ad4 for inspiration.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When applying polearms, the player may be prompted twice for a destination.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When triggering a level teleporter with a polearm, the polearm can end up
▒▒▒   embedded in solid stone on the target level, possibly beyond the edges of
▒▒▒   where the player can dig.  This is not intended.  (It should land on floor.)
▒▒▒   I suspect I am using deliver_object() in an unanticipated way.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Cherry-pick from xnethack:
▒▒▒   + 099a3f0 copperwater: Add Dudley as a ghost name
▒▒▒   + f0c9bde copperwater: Candelabrum now reads "(n/7 candles attached)"...
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FMOB tileset issues:
▒▒▒   + Grasshopper suggests some weapons (spears, polearms)
▒▒▒     don't need their full haft length, could do with more
▒▒▒     detail on the operative bits instead.
▒▒▒   + The air elemental tile isn't very good.  Redraw.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Differentiate ancient dragons in DawnHack.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 03:22 < nht > an oddity in fourk
▒▒▒   03:22 < nht > as a scurrier I can dig down while wielding a weapon on dungeon floor
▒▒▒   03:22 < nht > but not when I'm in a pit
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Add program icons for the the level and dungeon compilers.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 10:36 < AmyBSOD\dislex > Oh, and on an unrelated note, trying to move into an undiggable
▒▒▒                            wall as a scurrier seems to produce no message at all.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at FIQ's multiturn movement fix:  [reverted: 98a9db1], 6a5dcba, 6648540
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 19:12 < FIQ > jonadab: 73e8721caf89aa966cdf03af258dde5374f33598 might interest you
▒▒▒   This is the thing that shows you your carry cap and total # of inventory slots in the sidebar.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rather than nerf longswords, it's tempting to buff all the other
▒▒▒   weapons.  Long swords are d8/d12, ok, so make broadsword
▒▒▒   2d4/d9+1, scimitar and saber d8/d10, morning star 2d4/d8+1,
▒▒▒   flail d6+1/3d3, mace d6+1/2d4, etc.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * In challenge mode, turn item destruction up to eleven, complete with rust and
▒▒▒   corrosion destroying thoroughly rusted/corroded (non-unique) items completely.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 20:53 < aosdict > jonadab: also, monsters generating in (not inaccessible) closets could be a part of your
▒▒▒                     plan to increase monster generation on level creation and decrease the normal generation rate
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Fix mazewalk (walkfrom) so the same map-relative coordinates work regardless of the values
▒▒▒   of ROWNO and COLNO.  Fix the two Castles that were cherry-picked via BingeHack4,
▒▒▒   and re-enable them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * per rumflump, make #monster <direction> work for digging as a scurrier, so the user
▒▒▒   can dig things like a boulder or known-locked door without bumping into it first.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at and consider FIQ's autoswap feature, 719b864d5f
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Reconsider item weights:
▒▒▒   + armor
▒▒▒   + weapons
▒▒▒   + tools
▒▒▒   + books
▒▒▒   + potions
▒▒▒   + other
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider whether crystal plate mail needs further buffs.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Item destruction rework:
▒▒▒   + Make extrinsic resistances protect against erosion from that element.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * It appears that material-sensitive players can wield weapons made of the
▒▒▒   material in question without difficulty or consequence, provided you do
▒▒▒   not change form _while_ wielding the item.  (This is true for silver
▒▒▒   in .4, and probably upstream even, but I want to fix it in a general way,
▒▒▒   not only for silver.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make sure monsters can't wear armor too large or small for them.
▒▒▒   (Not sure if boots and cloaks and gloves are handled yet.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When hallucinating, statues should appear to be monsters, and perform
▒▒▒   hallucinatory actions, such as singing, dancing, etc.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Makedefs must die.  Triage when to refactor each of the things it does:
▒▒▒   + DONE (.4): monstr[]
▒▒▒   + DONE (.5): oracles.txt => oracles (breaks save compat)
▒▒▒   + rumors.tru + rumors.fal => rumors
▒▒▒   + data.base => data
▒▒▒   + quest.txt => quest.dat
▒▒▒   + dungeon.def => dungeon.pdf
▒▒▒   + date.h
▒▒▒   + verinfo.h
▒▒▒   + readonly.c
▒▒▒     * bases[]
▒▒▒     * timezone_list[] / timezone_spec
▒▒▒     * polyinit_list[] / polyinit_spec
▒▒▒   + onames.h
▒▒▒   + permonst.h
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look into the "A a boulder bounces" bug (probably channelization-related).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Figure out what further buffs to do to martial arts, if any.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance the regeneration of HP.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * More special Level Versions:
▒▒▒   + Garden of Temptation
▒▒▒   + Dream up another couple versions of Mine's End.
▒▒▒   + Demon lairs.
▒▒▒   + Sanctum.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * From K-Mod:
▒▒▒   + Consider: d0c9cf1f691f (shopkeepers pick up gold they step onto)
▒▒▒   + Items shouldn't spawn on holes, see 6381113dd84ba7
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the nethack-mapgen-lower-mines-with-closets.pl algorithm.
▒▒▒   Use it sometimes (maybe 1/3) in deep Mines levels (last 2-3 levels
▒▒▒   before Mine's End).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make being stormprone work on monsters.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * teach body_part about "teeth" (and fix the TODO in sounds.c).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at DynaHack's skill progress bars.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at dnethack's skill progress indicators.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding a page to Ctrl-x with information about what
▒▒▒   is good and bad for your alignment record given your current
▒▒▒   race/role/alignment combination.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * After some players play .4 a bit, decide if the speed formulae
▒▒▒   require further revision for balance.
▒▒▒ * Consider, and if necessary tweak, the balance of speed.
▒▒▒   Also, make intrinsic and extrinsic and temporary speed stack
▒▒▒   for monsters, same as for players.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making early-game poison instadeath, when you're too low-level
▒▒▒   to have a level drained, drain other stats instead, like HP, PW, Str, Con.
▒▒▒   FIQ says divine anger does this.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Perhaps cursed gain level should simply deposit you on the down stairs
▒▒▒   (of the level above) if you have the Amulet.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Further improve the spoilers for playable races and roles.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Racial-weapon chest contents (e.g., dwarvish spears if you are a dwarf)
▒▒▒   should probably be substituted out for something else if you are
▒▒▒   restricted in the corresponding skill.  For example, a Dwa Arc gets
▒▒▒   dwarvish spears but is restricted in them.  Either that, or else this:
▒▒▒   09:56 <      hackedhead > no. i mean, for every racial weapons that exists, the relevant
▒▒▒                             should be allowed to reach basic in the corresponding skill
▒▒▒   09:57 <      hackedhead > so dwarves should be able to reach basic in spear, short sword.
▒▒▒   09:57 <      hackedhead > orcs: dagger, spear, bow
▒▒▒   09:57 <      hackedhead > elves: dagger, spear, bow, broadsword
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make mvm and uvm poison instandeath work like mvp poison instadeath.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance the formula for when you can squeeze past or not.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow scurriers to outright move _onto_ a tree tile, and give them a movement
▒▒▒   point discount/rebate (maybe NORMAL_SPEED * 2 / 3) when they do so.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 08:12 < FIQ > jonadab, certain forms of resistances should be foolproof in challenge mode too...
▒▒▒   08:12 < FIQ > e.g. taking fire damage as a fire vortex makes no sense
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider cherry-picking pool rooms from Dyna, and look at its special levels.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow fireproof scrolls to be wished for, and make them actually
▒▒▒   fireproof.  Ensure that blanking/writing don't alter their fireproof
▒▒▒   status.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make some weapon skills harder to learn than others, either in terms of
▒▒▒   practice required, or skill points invested, or both.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the autounlock feature as in DynaHack.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Fine tune the balance on the Pw regen formula, especially
▒▒▒   as regards Sylphs.  See discussion in #nhfourk from Sunday,
▒▒▒   Feburary 5th, starting at 7:13, don't miss the late part
▒▒▒   of the discussion around 7:40.
▒▒▒ * 12:28 < FIQ > fu nfact: in fourk, sylphs at <12 constitution heal 1hp per turn in hell, at >=12 they don't heal at all
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider how the Staff of Aesculalialdkjlaius should work for Sylphs.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒   Post-Rebase
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * A clear "This save file is from 4.3.0.5 or earlier" would be much better than
▒▒▒   the current situation with old-version saves.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * defined monster groups for level generation, similar to what Brogue has, but
▒▒▒   possibly with items in some cases.  A small number of examples:
▒▒▒   + One orc-captain and 5-10 other o
▒▒▒   + One troll and 5-10 o
▒▒▒   + One of each color of unicorn
▒▒▒   + 3-5 black light and 10-20 manes
▒▒▒   + One purple worm and 5-10 shriekers
▒▒▒   + Three n and a wand of make invisible
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒   Untriaged Stuff:
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 14:11 <     FIQ > jonadab: if you're going to do stuff like achievement tracking
▒▒▒   14:11 <     FIQ > you could also add stuff like tracking what kind of monsters players have met over time, etc
▒▒▒   14:11 <     FIQ > and tried out
▒▒▒   14:12 <     FIQ > and give that info if asked
▒▒▒   14:13 < jonadab > You mean like "You have encountered an Arch-lich 27 times in 23 games, vanquishing 8 of them"?
▒▒▒   14:14 <     FIQ > I meant more for taking notes for the player
▒▒▒   14:14 < jonadab > I don't think I understand.
▒▒▒   14:14 <     FIQ > if a player has eaten a shrieker corpse
▒▒▒   14:14 <     FIQ > and it gave poison res
▒▒▒   14:15 <     FIQ > the game will tell the player this if asked with extended info that they give poison res
▒▒▒   14:15 <     FIQ > in the future
▒▒▒   14:15 <     FIQ > stuff like that
▒▒▒   14:16 <     FIQ > you could then relegate stuff like poison/acid warnings to only show up if the player has seen it do this earlier
▒▒▒   14:17 <     FIQ > let players explore, let them find stuff out on their own
▒▒▒   14:17 <     FIQ > but keep track for the player
▒▒▒   14:18 <     FIQ > you could also do stuff like only letting people polyinit-play into creatures they've already killed at least once
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider replacing amulet of ESP with amulet of monster detection
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide whether to cherry-pick the vampire shapeshifter stuff (sans wolves)
▒▒▒   from the 3.6 series, with all its bug fixes, A) now, B) later, or C) never.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Haste self should give permanent, not temporary, speed.  Perhaps
▒▒▒   intrinsic at low skill levels, extrinsic or both at high levels.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow two-handed weapons to be enchanted to +10?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Enchanting a weapon to +5 or higher should identify its enchantment level.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Should converting an altar grant an alignment bonus?  (hackedhead's idea)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ thinks Stacked Dozen should be a prize level due to difficulty.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make charisma have the opposite effect on shop quotes when you are
▒▒▒   both same-race and also same-gender to the shopkeeper.  (Maybe?)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide whether to implement some or all of my Alchemy proposal.  For feedback,
▒▒▒   https://www.reddit.com/r/nethack/comments/5e1taf/request_for_comments_solventsolute_alchemy/
▒▒▒   See also rgrn and my logs from #nethack-dev starting on 2016-Nov-20.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 20:32 < Grasshopper_ > YANI: blessed polymorph potion allows you to choose the poly form
▒▒▒   20:54 <      jonadab > You know, as rare as those are, I think that would actually be ok.
▒▒▒   But then I remembered, polymorph is a key deterrent to quaff-identifying potions.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 13:06 < Chris_ANG > unfamilliar (and also familliar >_<) mosters turning
▒▒▒                       out to be a member of your own race has been a constant
▒▒▒                       problem in dNethack, right?
▒▒▒   13:07 < Chris_ANG > I'm going to make it so that a sufficiently-well-aligned
▒▒▒                       character gets a warning before doing something that
▒▒▒                       would result in canibalism or same-race sacrifice. 
▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒   4.3.0.6 or Later:
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Track the player's alignment record separately for each of the three alignments,
▒▒▒   so that HoOA can be handled reasonably.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Hunger rework:
▒▒▒   + Rings of slow digestion and hunger are the same chargeable ring, with opposite
▒▒▒     charges.  Call it ring of digestion.  When positively charged, it speeds your
▒▒▒     digestion; when negative, it slows it.  Go ahead and let it protect against
▒▒▒     _being_ digested regardless of its charge/enchantment.
▒▒▒   + Things like spellcasting and teleportation no longer cause hunger.  The only
▒▒▒     way to hunger faster than usual is via a (positive) ring of digestion.
▒▒▒   + Tinning kits use charges proportional to corpse weight.  (This makes tinning dragons
▒▒▒     for their intrinsics more expensive.)
▒▒▒   + Intrinsics gained by eating now gradually time out.  Balance the rate of this
▒▒▒     so that eating food that does NOT grant intrinsics is almost always suboptimal
▒▒▒     strategy, because it means you'll end up bloated (or missing some resistance)
▒▒▒     or have to expend scrolls of charging on a tinning kit.
▒▒▒   + Make sure cursed food doesn't grant useful intrinsics.  (It may already not; check.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Bats should be able to echolocate around corners, up to some limited number of LOS bounces (maybe 3).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Clear up remaining niggles with the Garden implementation, see the
▒▒▒   commit log notes on commit commit 302d5fa9072.  Some of this may
▒▒▒   require levcomp overhaul and so may get pushed back further.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make wielding and throwing separate skills for daggers and knives.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Instead of true/false, I want corridorbranch to be an enum:
▒▒▒      stop:  branching corridors stop movement (except targetted travel)
▒▒▒      stop_when_exploring (default): discovering a new branch stops movement;
▒▒▒                           but previously explored ones don't.
▒▒▒      keep_going: branching corridors do not interrupt movement.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Khor says, definitely look at the demon lairs in dnethack.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Move Nagas into S, freeing N for some other use.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making diagonal movement between a pit or hole and
▒▒▒   something solid (such as a wall or boulder) cause you to fall
▒▒▒   into the pit or hole.  Revise the Count Carefully Sokoban
▒▒▒   level (and rename it).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement Un-style HTML dumplogs.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider how long potions of hallucination should last, and,
▒▒▒   if those are nerfed a bit, what other quaff-identification
▒▒▒   deterrents could supplement them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider changing the 18 -> 18/** -> 25 progression for Str,
▒▒▒   see comments lower in this file about that.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding an additional option for animation, to control
▒▒▒   the duration of the delay between frames.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding some kind of consolation special level that
▒▒▒   only generates when Ludios doesn't (accessible a different way).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Think through possible uses of restore_attrib and the ability to
▒▒▒   _temporarily_ boost or penalize the users' attributes.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide what to do about Minetown rules -- monsters can freely do
▒▒▒   things that would anger the Watch if the player did them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at raisse's idea for a better Arc quest artifact,
▒▒▒   http://valdyas.org/~irina/stonecutter
